/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<p>In the directories <code>/aula_B0.485/data/movie_details-p4.json</code> and <code>/aula_B0.485/data/movie_details.json</code>, the same data exists, as is the case for the directories <code>/aula_B0.485/data/reviews-p4.json</code> and <code>/aula_B0.485/data/reviews.json</code>.</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<p>-Partitioning by <code>rating</code> in HDFS divides the files into subdirectories based on the <code>rating</code> value. This facilitates specific queries about movies with a particular rating, improving performance by avoiding a full dataset scan.</p>
<p>-The <code>movie_details</code> file contains information about movies, so partitioning by <code>movie_id</code> could make sense for analyses or queries based on the unique identifier of each movie. By partitioning by <code>movie_id</code>, each partition would contain information about a specific movie, which could improve performance if most queries are related to a particular movie.</p>

<pre>Row(duration=&#39;1h 42min&#39;, genre=[&#39;Crime&#39;, &#39;Drama&#39;], plot_summary=&#39;Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.                Written by\nLion Films&#39;, plot_synopsis=&#39;A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries, then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes, most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens, and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City, sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce, a Wall Street financial institution, are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas), David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says &#34;This is a chick\&#39;s restaurant. Why aren\&#39;t we at Dorsia?&#34; McDermott replies &#34;Because Bateman won\&#39;t give the maitre d\&#39; head.&#34; Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant, including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there\&#39;s no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account, which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. &#34;Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?&#34; says Patrick. &#34;I\&#39;ve seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah.&#34; Bateman rebukes him. &#34;Not a menorah. A dreidel, you spin a dreidel.&#34; McDermott replies &#34;Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?&#34; &#34;No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.&#34; &#34;Oh I forgot. Bateman\&#39;s dating someone from the ACLU!&#34; Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks &#34;Speaking of reasonable, only $570.&#34; They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub, Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag, who lets them inside. As some 80\&#39;s pop music plays from overhead, the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket, but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays, and then when she\&#39;s out of earshot, he says &#34;You\&#39;re a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, then play around with your blood.&#34; He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman\&#39;s apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white, with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated, but looks expensive. &#34;I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street, on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I\&#39;m 27 years old.&#34; He describes his diet and exercise routine, and his meticulous daily grooming rituals, which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. &#34;There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,&#34; he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. &#34;Some kind of abstraction. But there is no \&#39;real me\&#39;. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.&#34;Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York, the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office, Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says &#34;Hey Hamilton. Nice tan.&#34; Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), to his office door. She\&#39;s dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. &#34;Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?&#34; She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled, but she doesn\&#39;t know what he cancelled or why. &#34;I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club.&#34; She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. &#34;What should I say?&#34; &#34;Just say no.&#34; He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch, as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. &#34;Something romantic?&#34; &#34;No, silly. Forget it. I\&#39;ll make them. Just get me a mineral water.&#34; She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her, he tells her not to wear that outfit. &#34;Wear a dress or a skirt. You\&#39;re prettier than that.&#34; The phone starts ringing, and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn\&#39;t there. &#34;And high heels.&#34; She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside, Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones, but his &#34;supposed&#34; fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can\&#39;t take the time off work to get married. &#34;Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. You hate that job anyway, I don\&#39;t see why you don\&#39;t just quit.&#34; &#34;Because... I want... to fit... IN.&#34; The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. &#34;I\&#39;m on the verge of tears as we arrive, since I\&#39;m positive we won\&#39;t have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me, in an awesome wave.&#34; Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. &#34;This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash,&#34; says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks, and then starts kissing her neck, slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi, he remarks &#34;I\&#39;m fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know.&#34; Bateman doesn\&#39;t care because he\&#39;s also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her best friend. &#34;She\&#39;s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs, tonight I believe it\&#39;s Xanax.&#34; She\&#39;s also engaged to Luis Carruthers, &#34;the biggest doofus in the business.&#34; Courtney and Luis are seated beside him, and Courtney, slurring her words, asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. &#34;Yes. I read that,&#34; says Luis. &#34;Oh who gives a rat\&#39;s ass,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;That affects us,&#34; says Vanden. &#34;What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Don\&#39;t you know that the Sikhs are killing like, tons of Israelis over there?&#34; Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid, nuclear arms, terrorism, and world hunger. &#34;We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, and less materialism in young people.&#34; Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. &#34;Patrick, how thought-provoking,&#34; Luis says, feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It\&#39;s nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says &#34;hello&#34;. She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day, Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can\&#39;t bleach that type of sheet, and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can\&#39;t understand. &#34;Lady, if you don\&#39;t shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.&#34; She is shocked, but still won\&#39;t speak English. &#34;I can\&#39;t understand you! You\&#39;re a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!&#34; A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. &#34;It\&#39;s so silly to come all the way up here,&#34; she says, &#34;but they really are the best.&#34; &#34;Then why can\&#39;t they get these stains out?&#34; he says, showing her the sheets. &#34;Can you get through to them? I\&#39;m getting nowhere.&#34; &#34;What are those?&#34; she says, looking wide-eyed at the stains. &#34;Uh, well it\&#39;s cranberry juice. Cran-apple.&#34; She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes, and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he\&#39;s booked solid. &#34;What about Saturday?&#34; &#34;Next Saturday? Can\&#39;t. Matinee of Les Mis.&#34; He promises to call her, and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear, on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. &#34;You\&#39;re dating Luis, he\&#39;s in Arizona. You\&#39;re fucking me and we haven\&#39;t made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?&#34; She says she\&#39;s waiting for Luis to call. &#34;Pumpkin you\&#39;re dating an asshole. Pumpkin you\&#39;re dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you\&#39;re dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.&#34; She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner, and when she says no, he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant, and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo, Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day, while she is almost passing out from her medication. &#34;Is that Donald Trump\&#39;s car?&#34; he asks, looking out the window. Patrick\&#39;s face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium, or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. &#34;I just want a child,&#34; she says, absently looking out the window. &#34;Just two... perfect... children.&#34;At the restaurant, she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. &#34;Are we here?&#34; she asks sleepily. &#34;Yeah,&#34; he says, sitting down. &#34;This is Dorsia?&#34; &#34;Yes dear,&#34; he says, opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she\&#39;s going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. &#34;New York Matinee called it a \&#39;playful but mysterious little dish. You\&#39;ll love it.&#34; He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him, and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&amp;P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. &#34;Dorsia, how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?&#34; &#34;Lucky I guess,&#34; replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. &#34;Valentino Couture?&#34; &#34;Uh-huh.&#34; Luis tries to touch it, but Patrick slaps his hand away. &#34;Your compliment was sufficient Luis.&#34; Paul Allen comes up to them. &#34;Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?&#34; Narrating, Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for &#34;this dickhead Marcus Halberstram.&#34; They both work at P&amp;P and do the same exact work, and wear the same glasses and suits. &#34;Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut.&#34; Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia, Marcus\&#39; girlfriend. &#34;She\&#39;s great, I\&#39;m very lucky,&#34; replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in, congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. &#34;Thank you, Baxter.&#34; Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. &#34;Call me.&#34; &#34;How about Friday?&#34; says Bryce. &#34;No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche.&#34; He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he\&#39;s lying. Bateman takes out his new business card, which reads &#34;Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President&#34;. &#34;What do you think?&#34; &#34;Very nice,&#34; says McDermott. &#34;I picked them up from the printers yesterday.&#34; &#34;Nice coloring,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;That\&#39;s \&#39;bone\&#39;. And the lettering is something called \&#39;silian rail\&#39;.&#34; &#34;Cool Bateman. But that\&#39;s nothing,&#34; says Van Paten, laying his card down next to Patrick\&#39;s. &#34;That is really nice,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?&#34; Van Paten asks Patrick. &#34;Nice,&#34; Patrick says, visibly jealous. &#34;How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?&#34; says Bryce. Biting his nails, Patrick can\&#39;t believe Bryce prefers Van Paten\&#39;s card. &#34;You ain\&#39;t seen nothing yet,&#34; says Bryce, taking out his own card. &#34;Raised lettering, pale nimbus, white.&#34; Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage, Bateman tells him it\&#39;s very nice. &#34;Let\&#39;s see Paul Allen\&#39;s card.&#34; Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room, even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating, Patrick says &#34;Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!&#34; He drops the card on the table. &#34;Something wrong?&#34; asks Luis. &#34;Patrick? You\&#39;re sweating.&#34;Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley, a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him, to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. &#34;Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?&#34; He starts taking out some money. &#34;I\&#39;m hungry,&#34; says the bum. &#34;It\&#39;s cold out too isn\&#39;t it? If you\&#39;re so hungry, why don\&#39;t you get a job?&#34; The bum says he lost his job. &#34;Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking.&#34; He asks him his name, and the bum says his name is Al. &#34;Get a god-damn job, Al! You have a negative attitude. That\&#39;s what\&#39;s stopping you.&#34; He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he\&#39;s a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick\&#39;s arm, and Patrick pulls it off, visibly disgusted. &#34;You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?&#34; He laughs, and then apologizes. &#34;I don\&#39;t have anything in common with you.&#34; He bends down and opens his briefcase. &#34;Oh thank you mister, thank you. It\&#39;s cold out here...&#34; &#34;You know what a fucking loser you are?&#34; Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach, than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick, so he stomps it with his foot, hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick\&#39;s face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later, another Asian woman gives him a manicure. &#34;I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed, and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me, and I don\&#39;t know why.&#34; He is lying in a tanning bed now. &#34;My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.&#34;A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. \&#39;Deck The Halls\&#39; is playing in the background. Patrick takes one, scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. &#34;Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas,&#34; says Patrick. &#34;Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?&#34; He points to Paul Allen across the room. &#34;Of course. Who else?&#34; Evelyn comes up to them. &#34;Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You\&#39;re late honey.&#34; &#34;I\&#39;ve been here the entire time, you just didn\&#39;t see me.&#34; A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick\&#39;s head without him noticing. &#34;Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says \&#39;hello Patrick\&#39;&#34;, she says in a childish voice. &#34;What is it?&#34; Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. &#34;It\&#39;s a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn\&#39;t it? It\&#39;s a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don\&#39;t you? Don\&#39;t you?&#34; Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. &#34;Stop scowling Patrick. You\&#39;re such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don\&#39;t say breast implants again.&#34; Ignoring her, he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. \&#39;Joy to the World\&#39; is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. &#34;Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas, how\&#39;ve you been. Workaholic I suppose?&#34; He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell\&#39;s bar, and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. &#34;Cecilia would adore it.&#34; &#34;Then let\&#39;s do it, Marcus.&#34; Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party, and then walks away. &#34;Why is he calling you Marcus?&#34; asks Evelyn. Ignoring this, Patrick says &#34;Mistletoe alert!&#34;, and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated, and he is arguing with a waiter. &#34;I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty.&#34; Patrick ignores this and orders a J&amp;B straight and a Corona. The waiter, who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck, starts to list the specials, but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. &#34;Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?&#34; &#34;Not if you want to keep your spleen,&#34; says Patrick. The waiter leaves. &#34;This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot, very hot,&#34; Paul comments sarcastically. &#34;The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here,&#34; replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. &#34;I\&#39;m a child of divorce, give me a break. I see they\&#39;ve omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o.&#34; Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. &#34;Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?&#34; Patrick says, looking behind him. &#34;Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?&#34; He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. &#34;Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I\&#39;d have to kill ya!&#34; He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says &#34;I like to dissect girls. Did you know I\&#39;m utterly insane?&#34; Paul doesn\&#39;t seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon, Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. &#34;You should look into it.&#34; Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. &#34;I think she\&#39;s having dinner with Evelyn Williams.&#34; &#34;Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman, what a dork!&#34; Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. &#34;Another martini Paul?&#34;Patrick\&#39;s apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. &#34;Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?&#34; &#34;They\&#39;re OK,&#34; says Paul. Patrick continues &#34;Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when \&#39;Sports\&#39; came out in \&#39;83, I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically.&#34; He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. &#34;The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism, that really gives the songs a big boost!&#34; He takes a valium, washes it down, looks at himself in the mirror, and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards, he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello, but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. &#34;Hey Halberstram,&#34; says Paul. &#34;Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?&#34; He laughs. &#34;No Allen.&#34; &#34;Is that a raincoat?&#34; &#34;Yes it is!&#34; He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song \&#39;Hip to Be Square\&#39; starts playing. &#34;In \&#39;87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \&#39;Hip to Be Square\&#39;.&#34; He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. &#34;The song is so catchy, most people probably don\&#39;t listen to the lyrics, but they should, because it\&#39;s not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it\&#39;s also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!&#34; Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming, he swings it into Paul\&#39;s head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor, pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells &#34;Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!&#34; He swings it down again, and again, screaming, decapitating him. &#34;You... fucking... bastard!&#34; He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. \&#39;Hip to Be Square\&#39; continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him, and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside, and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It\&#39;s Luis. &#34;Patrick. Is that you?&#34; &#34;No Luis. It\&#39;s not me. You\&#39;re mistaken.&#34; He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. &#34;We\&#39;re going to Nell\&#39;s. Gwendolyn\&#39;s father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?&#34; He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. &#34;Jean-Paul Gaultier.&#34; Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later, he arrives at Paul\&#39;s apartment. &#34;I almost panic when I realize that Paul\&#39;s place overlooks the park, and is obviously more expensive than mine.&#34; He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. &#34;It\&#39;s time for Paul to take a little trip.&#34; He throws some clothes in a suitcase, and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul\&#39;s voice, he records &#34;It\&#39;s Paul. I\&#39;ve been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I\&#39;ll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.&#34; He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day, Patrick listens to the song \&#39;The Lady in Red\&#39; by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there\&#39;s someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. &#34;Who?&#34; &#34;Detective Donald Kimball.&#34; He looks through the office window. &#34;Tell him I\&#39;m at lunch.&#34; &#34;Patrick, it\&#39;s only 10:30. I think he knows you\&#39;re here.&#34; &#34;Send him in, I guess,&#34; he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone, giving him advice on clothes and salons. &#34;Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I\&#39;ve gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh, just joking. No, don\&#39;t tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it.&#34; He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. &#34;No I\&#39;m sorry, I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?&#34; Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. &#34;Mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.&#34; They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. &#34;So, what\&#39;s the topic of discussion?&#34; Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. &#34;I just have some basic questions.&#34; Patrick offers him coffee, which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water, which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. &#34;It\&#39;s no problem.&#34; He asks what the topic of discussion is again, and Kimball repeats he\&#39;s investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle, and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn\&#39;t heard anything. &#34;I think his family wants this kept quiet.&#34; &#34;Understandable. Lime?&#34; offers Bateman. Kimball insists he\&#39;s ok. He asks Patrick his age, where he went to school, and his address, the American Gardens building, which Kimball says is very nice. &#34;Thanks,&#34; Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. &#34;I\&#39;m at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing.&#34; Kimball asks him what he means. &#34;Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.&#34; Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. &#34;I hope I\&#39;m not being cross-examined here.&#34; &#34;You feel like that?&#34; &#34;No. Not really.&#34; Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. &#34;He had a yacht?&#34; &#34;No, he just hung out there.&#34; &#34;And where did he go to school?&#34; &#34;Don\&#39;t you know this?&#34; &#34;I just wanted to know if you know.&#34; Patrick tells him St. Paul\&#39;s, then says he just wants to help. &#34;I understand.&#34; Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine, and that Meredith doesn\&#39;t think he went to London. &#34;Has anyone seen him in London?&#34; &#34;Actually, yes. But I\&#39;m having a hard time getting actual verification.&#34; He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet, but Kimball says no. &#34;Basically, no-one\&#39;s seen or heard anything. It\&#39;s just strange. One day someone\&#39;s walking around, going to work, alive, and then...&#34; &#34;Nothing.&#34; &#34;People just disappear,&#34; says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says &#34;The earth just... opens up and swallows them.&#34; &#34;Eerie. Really eerie.&#34; Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. &#34;The Four Seasons? Isn\&#39;t that a little far up town? I mean, aren\&#39;t you going to be late?&#34; &#34;No, there\&#39;s one down here.&#34; Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything, and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat, a hooker, stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she\&#39;s been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. &#34;I haven\&#39;t seen you around here,&#34; he tells her. &#34;Well you just haven\&#39;t been looking.&#34; &#34;Would you like to see my apartment?&#34; She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. &#34;I\&#39;m not supposed to, but I can make an exception,&#34; she says, taking the money. &#34;Do you take a credit card? Just joking.&#34; He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. &#34;I\&#39;d like a girl, early 20\&#39;s, blonde, who does couples. And I really can\&#39;t stress blonde enough. Blonde.&#34; He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen, and that he\&#39;s going to call her Christie. &#34;You\&#39;ll respond only to Christie, is that clear?&#34; She nods.Patrick\&#39;s apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub, where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. &#34;That\&#39;s a very fine chardonnay you\&#39;re drinking.&#34; The song \&#39;If You Don\&#39;t Know Me by Now\&#39; is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. &#34;I want you to clean your vagina,&#34; he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. &#34;From behind. Get on your knees.&#34; He tells her she has a nice body, playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It\&#39;s the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe, then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl, and takes her coat. &#34;I\&#39;m Paul. Not quite blonde, are you? More like dirty blonde. I\&#39;m going to call you Sabrina. I\&#39;m Paul Allen.&#34; He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no, lewdly. &#34;Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?&#34; Sabrina shakes her head, and Patrick clenches his jaw. &#34;You have a really nice place here Paul,&#34; says Christie. &#34;How much did you pay for it?&#34; &#34;Well actually Christie, that\&#39;s none of your business. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn\&#39;t cheap.&#34; Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. &#34;No! No smoking in here.&#34; He offers them chocolate truffles. &#34;I don\&#39;t want to get you drunk, but uh, that\&#39;s a very fine chardonnay you\&#39;re not drinking.&#34; He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. &#34;I\&#39;ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, \&#39;Duke\&#39;. Before that, I really didn\&#39;t understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin\&#39;s presence became more apparent.&#34; He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom, invitingly. &#34;I think Invisible Touch is the group\&#39;s undisputed masterpiece.&#34; The girls follow him into the bedroom. &#34;It\&#39;s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.&#34; He tells Christie to take off the robe, which she does. &#34;Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument,&#34; he says, setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. &#34;In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don\&#39;t you dance a little? Take the lyrics to \&#39;Land of Confusion\&#39;. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. \&#39;In Too Deep\&#39; is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,&#34; he continues, wrapping a scarf around Christie\&#39;s neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. &#34;About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I\&#39;ve heard in rock.&#34; He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. &#34;Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin\&#39;s solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like \&#39;In the Air Tonight\&#39; and \&#39;Against All Odds\&#39;. Sabrina, don\&#39;t just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word \&#39;artist\&#39;.&#34; He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. &#34;This is \&#39;Sussudio\&#39;, a great, great song. A personal favorite.&#34; He walks back to the bedroom, unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex, then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie\&#39;s arm touches his. &#34;Don\&#39;t touch the watch.&#34; He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors, carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. &#34;Can we go now?&#34; asks Christie. &#34;We\&#39;re not through yet.&#34;Some time later, he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina\&#39;s nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott, Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them, discussing women. &#34;If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, who fucking cares?&#34; says McDermott. &#34;Well let\&#39;s just say hypothetically, what if they have a good personality?&#34; replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence, and then all three men burst out laughing. &#34;There are no girls with good personalities!&#34; they say in unison, high-fiving each other. Van Paten says &#34;A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.&#34; McDermott continues: &#34;The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks.&#34; Van Paten agrees. &#34;And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.&#34; Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: &#34;Ed Gein? Maitre d\&#39; at Canal Bar?&#34; &#34;No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50\&#39;s.&#34; &#34;What did Ed say?&#34; &#34;He said \&#39;When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.\&#39;&#34; McDermott: &#34;And what did the other part of him think?&#34; &#34;What her head would look like on a stick!&#34; Bateman laughs heartily, but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. &#34;Is that all you ever have to contribute?&#34; snaps Bateman. &#34;Fucking dinner?&#34; McDermott tells him to cheer up. &#34;What\&#39;s the matter? No shiatsu this morning?&#34; Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. &#34;Do that again and you\&#39;ll draw back a stub.&#34; McDermott tells him &#34;Hang on there little buddy,&#34; but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves, he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking, he slowly puts his fingers around Luis\&#39; neck. Luis turns around, looks at Patrick\&#39;s hands, takes off one of his gloves, and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. &#34;God. Patrick, why here?&#34; Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can\&#39;t bring himself to kill Luis. &#34;I\&#39;ve seen you looking at me. I\&#39;ve noticed your... hot body,&#34; Luis says, rubbing a finger over Patrick\&#39;s mouth. &#34;Don\&#39;t be shy. You can\&#39;t imagine how long I\&#39;ve wanted this, ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie...&#34; Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands, with his gloves still on. He looks like he\&#39;s about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. &#34;I want you. I want you too!&#34; Patrick starts walking towards the door. &#34;Patrick?&#34; &#34;WHAT IS IT?&#34; he yells. &#34;Where are you going?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;ve got to return some videotapes.&#34;He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs, he sees Luis make a \&#39;call me\&#39; gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean\&#39;s desk, talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. &#34;I\&#39;ve been wanting to talk with you, come into my office,&#34; Patrick says, shaking his hand. &#34;Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?&#34;Inside his office. &#34;Do you remember where you were the night of Paul\&#39;s disappearance?&#34; asks Kimball. &#34;Which was on the 20th of December.&#34; &#34;God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes.&#34; He looks at his datebook. &#34;I had a date with a girl named Veronica.&#34; &#34;That\&#39;s not what I\&#39;ve got,&#34; says Kimball. &#34;What?&#34; &#34;That\&#39;s not the information I\&#39;ve received.&#34; &#34;What information have you received? I could be wrong.&#34; &#34;When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?&#34; &#34;We\&#39;d gone to a new musical called \&#39;Oh Africa, Brave Africa\&#39;. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I\&#39;ve been informative. Long day. I\&#39;m a bit scattered.&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so, when I\&#39;ve sorted out all of this information?&#34; Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. &#34;Absolutely. I\&#39;m with you on that one.&#34; Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. &#34;Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?&#34; Patrick is stunned, and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. &#34;Never. I mean I don\&#39;t really like singers.&#34; &#34;Not a big music fan, huh?&#34; &#34;No I like music, just they\&#39;re... Huey\&#39;s too black sounding for me.&#34; &#34;To each his own.&#34; Kimball closes his briefcase. &#34;So, lunch next week?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;ll be there.&#34;Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms, then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself, putting it on Courtney\&#39;s lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. &#34;Will you call me before Easter?&#34; she asks. &#34;Maybe.&#34; &#34;What are you doing tonight?&#34; &#34;Dinner at uh, River Cafe.&#34; &#34;That\&#39;s nice,&#34; she says, lighting a cigarette. &#34;I never knew you smoked.&#34; &#34;You never noticed. Listen, Patrick, can we talk?&#34; &#34;You look... marvelous. There\&#39;s nothing to say,&#34; he says, shutting her out. &#34;You\&#39;re going to marry Luis.&#34; &#34;Isn\&#39;t that special... Patrick? If I don\&#39;t see you before Easter, have a nice one okay?&#34; she asks, with a hint of depression in her voice. &#34;You too.&#34; He starts to leave. &#34;Patrick?&#34; &#34;Yeah?&#34; &#34;Nothing...&#34; He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song \&#39;Pump up the Volume\&#39; is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. &#34;There\&#39;s this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected, you can catch anything. Alzheimer\&#39;s, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia!&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m not sure but I don\&#39;t think dyslexia is a disease,&#34; says Bateman. &#34;But who knows? They don\&#39;t know that. Prove it.&#34; Bryce snorts some white powder. &#34;Oh God. It\&#39;s a fucking milligram of sweetener.&#34; Patrick sniffs some. &#34;I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.&#34; &#34;It\&#39;s definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we\&#39;ll be okay,&#34; says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. &#34;Could you keep it down? I\&#39;m trying to do drugs!&#34; &#34;Fuck you!&#34; says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. &#34;We\&#39;ll do it anyway.&#34; &#34;That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it\&#39;s okay!&#34; &#34;Fuck you!&#34; says the man. &#34;Fuck YOU!&#34; says Bryce. &#34;Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let\&#39;s do it.&#34;A club balcony. The song \&#39;What\&#39;s On Your Mind\&#39; is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. &#34;He\&#39;s the one behind Glasnost.&#34; Bryce makes a \&#39;he went to get cocaine\&#39; gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. &#34;I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions,&#34; she says. &#34;You\&#39;re not confused are you?&#34; asks Bryce. &#34;No, not really.&#34; Another woman says &#34;Gorbachev is NOT downstairs.&#34; &#34;Karen\&#39;s right, Gorbachev is not down stairs. He\&#39;s at Tunnel.&#34; Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. &#34;So what do you do?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m into uh, well murders and executions mostly.&#34; &#34;Do you like it?&#34; &#34;Well that depends, why?&#34; &#34;Well most guys I know, who work in mergers and acquisitions, really don\&#39;t like it.&#34; He asks her where she works out.On the street, Patrick and the girl are talking. &#34;You think I\&#39;m dumb don\&#39;t you. You think all models are dumb.&#34; &#34;No. I really don\&#39;t.&#34; &#34;That\&#39;s okay. I don\&#39;t mind. There\&#39;s something sweet about you.&#34; They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door, and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly, wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. &#34;Doin\&#39; the crossword?&#34; she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either \&#39;meat\&#39; or \&#39;bones\&#39;. She asks him if he needs any help, but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door, he says &#34;Jean, would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you\&#39;re not doing anything.&#34; She says she doesn\&#39;t have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. &#34;Well! Isn\&#39;t this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go?&#34; She says she doesn\&#39;t care where. &#34;How about anywhere you want?&#34; he tells her. &#34;I don\&#39;t know Patrick, I can\&#39;t make this decision.&#34; &#34;Come on!&#34; he says, chuckling and pointing his pen at her. &#34;Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere.&#34; She thinks for a minute. &#34;How about...&#34; Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. &#34;Dorsia?&#34; Patrick looks up. &#34;So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.&#34; &#34;I don\&#39;t know, we\&#39;ll go wherever you want to go.&#34; &#34;Dorsia is fine.&#34; He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. &#34;Dorsia, yes?&#34; says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at, oh, say nine o\&#39;clock?&#34; &#34;We\&#39;re totally booked.&#34; &#34;Really? That\&#39;s great.&#34; &#34;No I said we are totally booked!&#34; &#34;Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!&#34; He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. &#34;Yeah?&#34; he asks, taking off his sunglasses. &#34;You\&#39;re... dressed okay.&#34; &#34;You didn\&#39;t give a name.&#34; &#34;They know me,&#34; he lies. &#34;Why don\&#39;t you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?&#34; She smiles and starts to leave. &#34;And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.&#34;Jean looks out the window of Patrick\&#39;s place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She\&#39;s dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. &#34;Patrick it\&#39;s so elegant. What a wonderful view.&#34; Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. &#34;Jean, sorbet?&#34; &#34;Thanks Patrick. I\&#39;d love some.&#34; He gives it to her. &#34;Do you want a bite?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m on a diet, but thank you,&#34; he says. &#34;No need to lose any weight. You\&#39;re kidding right? You look great,&#34; she tells him. &#34;Very fit.&#34; &#34;You can always be thinner... look better.&#34; &#34;Well, maybe we shouldn\&#39;t go out to dinner. I don\&#39;t want to ruin your willpower.&#34; &#34;That\&#39;s alright. I\&#39;m not very good at controlling it anyway.&#34; He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. &#34;So, what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don\&#39;t tell me you enjoy working with children.&#34; She tells him she\&#39;d like to travel and maybe go back to school. &#34;I don\&#39;t really know. I\&#39;m at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities.&#34; Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. &#34;I\&#39;m just so unsure.&#34; He asks her if she has a boyfriend. &#34;No, not really.&#34; &#34;Interesting.&#34; &#34;Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?&#34; she asks. &#34;Maybe. I don\&#39;t know. Not really,&#34; he says with a smile. &#34;Jean, do you feel, fulfilled? I mean, in your life?&#34; &#34;I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I\&#39;ve really begun to think about changing myself, developing and growing.&#34; Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. &#34;Growing. I\&#39;m glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy\&#39;s first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?&#34; he laughs. &#34;Who\&#39;s Ted Bundy?&#34; &#34;Forget it.&#34; &#34;What\&#39;s that?&#34; &#34;Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.&#34; &#34;Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?&#34; She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. &#34;No! Put it in the carton!&#34; &#34;Sorry.&#34; He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. &#34;I\&#39;m looking for uh...&#34; He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. &#34;I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.&#34; His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings, and the answering machine picks it up. It\&#39;s Evelyn. &#34;Patrick... Patrick! I know you\&#39;re there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?&#34; He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. &#34;It\&#39;s me. Don\&#39;t try to hide. I hope you\&#39;re not out there with some number you picked up because you\&#39;re MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door.&#34; Jean sips some wine, looking at Patrick as she listens. &#34;Anyway you never called me and you said you would, and I\&#39;ll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you, but we\&#39;re having dinner with Melania and Taylor, you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we\&#39;re meeting at the Cornell club. So I\&#39;ll see you tomorrow morning honey!&#34; Patrick winces. &#34;Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye.&#34; She hangs up. Jean says &#34;Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?&#34; He doesn\&#39;t answer. &#34;I\&#39;m sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?&#34; &#34;Yeah,&#34; he finally says. &#34;I don\&#39;t think I can control myself.&#34; &#34;I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.&#34; She asks him if he wants her to go. &#34;I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don\&#39;t want to get hurt, do you?&#34; &#34;No, I guess not. I don\&#39;t want to get bruised.&#34; She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out, she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. &#34;Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.&#34;A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other, eating some beef dishes. &#34;So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?&#34; asks Kimball. &#34;I\&#39;m not sure. Uh, I had a shower, and some sorbet?&#34; &#34;I think you\&#39;re getting your dates mixed up.&#34; &#34;Well, where do you place Paul that night?&#34; He tells Patrick that according to his datebook, Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram, thought Marcus denied it. &#34;Does Marcus have an alibi?&#34; &#34;Yes. I\&#39;ve checked it out, it\&#39;s clean. Now, where were you?&#34; &#34;Well, where was Marcus?&#34; &#34;He wasn\&#39;t with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Fredrick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner, and... you.&#34; Patrick looks up. &#34;Oh right, yeah, of course.&#34; Kimball makes a \&#39;slipped your mind\&#39; gesture. &#34;We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.&#34; Kimball says &#34;Personally, I think the guy just went a little nutso, split town for a while, maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I\&#39;m pretty sure he\&#39;ll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn\&#39;t that right Patrick?&#34; he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She\&#39;s standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. &#34;I\&#39;m not so sure about this,&#34; she tells him. &#34;I had to go to emergency last time.&#34; He promises that this won\&#39;t be anything like last time. She says no. &#34;Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You\&#39;ll be safe.&#34; He holds out some money. Reluctantly, she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. &#34;Nothing like last time. I promise,&#34; he repeats. &#34;Alright.&#34; He tells her she\&#39;s looking great, and asks how she\&#39;s been. &#34;I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.&#34; &#34;Lawyers are so complicated,&#34; he says, writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her, waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it, but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again, moving over to let her get back in. &#34;Half now, half later.&#34; He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again, and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. &#34;She\&#39;ll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You\&#39;ll like her. She\&#39;s a very nice girl.&#34;Paul Allen\&#39;s apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon, and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. &#34;Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar, didn\&#39;t I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar.&#34; She talks on and on in a self-important tone, neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. &#34;It\&#39;s not that nice,&#34; he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. &#34;You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number.&#34; &#34;What do you mean? She was a hot number.&#34; &#34;If you had a platinum card she\&#39;d give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon, need I say more?&#34; She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. &#34;She\&#39;s my... cousin. She\&#39;s from... France,&#34; says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she\&#39;s calling doesn\&#39;t answer. &#34;Elizabeth, it\&#39;s 3 in the morning.&#34; &#34;He\&#39;s a god damn drug dealer, these are his peak hours.&#34; She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can\&#39;t remember where she is. &#34;Paul Allen\&#39;s.&#34; &#34;I want the number idiot. Anyway I\&#39;m at Paul Norman\&#39;s and I\&#39;ll try you again later, and if I don\&#39;t see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I\&#39;m going to sic my hairdresser on you.&#34; She hangs up. &#34;Did you know that guy who disappeared, didn\&#39;t he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?&#34; He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. &#34;Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon.&#34; &#34;Listen,&#34; he says. &#34;I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*.&#34; They stare at him. &#34;What\&#39;s wrong with that? It\&#39;s totally disease-free.&#34; &#34;Patrick you\&#39;re a lunatic.&#34; He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. &#34;Let\&#39;s not get lewd. I\&#39;m in no mood for lewd conversation.&#34; He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. &#34;You\&#39;re telling me you\&#39;ve never gotten it on with a girl?&#34; he asks Elizabeth. &#34;No. I\&#39;m not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?&#34; &#34;Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.&#34; &#34;Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS, Patrick. You\&#39;re making me feel weird.&#34;Some time later, the drugs having kicked in, and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully &#34;Did you know that Whitney Houston\&#39;s debut LP, called simply \&#39;Whitney Houston\&#39;, had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?&#34; Elizabeth starts laughing. &#34;You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?&#34; she laughs, falling off the couch. &#34;It\&#39;s hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But \&#39;The Greatest Love of All\&#39; is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written, about self-preservation, dignity, its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it\&#39;s not too late to better ourselves.&#34; Elizabeth is still laughing. &#34;Since, Elizabeth, it\&#39;s impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, but we can always empathize with ourselves. It\&#39;s an important message, crucial really, and it\&#39;s beautifully stated on the album.&#34;All three have sex, Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth\&#39;s torso, and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets, and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room, and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open, to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick\&#39;s existence finally revealed to her, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words \&#39;DIE YUPPIE SCUM\&#39; and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead, naked woman. Patrick runs in, covered in Elizabeth\&#39;s blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. &#34;Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!&#34; She runs through the living room and out into the hallway, pounding and screaming on neighbours\&#39; doors, but to no avail. Patrick runs after her, stark nude, and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap, waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom, he lets go, and the chainsaw falls end over end, finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn\&#39;t touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him, asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. &#34;I think Evelyn, that uh, we\&#39;ve lost touch.&#34; &#34;Why, what\&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asks, waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her, and she mouths &#34;It\&#39;s beautiful. I love it.&#34; &#34;My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It\&#39;s over, it\&#39;s all over,&#34; he tells her, scratching a red X over his drawing. &#34;Touchy touchy. I\&#39;m sorry I brought up the wedding. Let\&#39;s just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m fucking serious. It\&#39;s fucking over, us, this is no joke, uh, I don\&#39;t think we should see each other any more.&#34; &#34;But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends. I really don\&#39;t think it would work.&#34; She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth, but her stops her. &#34;I know that your friends are my friends, and I\&#39;ve thought about that. You can have \&#39;em.&#34; She finally understands. &#34;You\&#39;re really serious, aren\&#39;t you? What about the past? Our past?&#34; &#34;We never really shared one,&#34; he replies. &#34;You\&#39;re inhuman.&#34; &#34;No. I\&#39;m-I\&#39;m in touch with humanity.&#34; She starts crying. &#34;Evelyn I\&#39;m sorry, I just uh... you\&#39;re not terribly important to me.&#34; She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. &#34;I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes...&#34; &#34;What is it that you want?&#34; she cries. &#34;If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!&#34; he snaps. &#34;Oh God I can\&#39;t believe this,&#34; she weeps. &#34;I\&#39;m leaving,&#34; he says. &#34;I\&#39;ve assessed the situation and I\&#39;m leaving.&#34; &#34;But where are you going?&#34; &#34;I have to return some videotapes.&#34;Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. &#34;Here kitty kitty.&#34; He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: \&#39;FEED ME A STRAY CAT\&#39;. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM, but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat\&#39;s head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. &#34;Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!&#34; He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away, and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car, but every car on the street is locked, and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out, guns drawn. &#34;Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!&#34; He starts to put his hands up, then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover, firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots, and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck, he looks at the gun, then at his watch, and walks away. He breaks into a run, under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. &#34;Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Don\&#39;t forget to sign in,&#34; says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door, back into the lobby, shoots the janitor, then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat, he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen, signs in, and goes up in the elevator, crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window, then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying, he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. &#34;Harold, it\&#39;s Bateman. You\&#39;re my lawyer so I think you should know, I\&#39;ve killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10, um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man, some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can\&#39;t remember maybe a model, but she\&#39;s dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell\&#39;s Kitchen. I don\&#39;t want to leave anything out here. I guess I\&#39;ve killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um...&#34; He almost can\&#39;t say it. &#34;I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little.&#34; He starts laughing. &#34;Tonight I, uh, hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!&#34; Crying again. &#34;And I\&#39;m not sure I\&#39;m gonna get away with it this time. I guess I\&#39;ll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I\&#39;m a pretty uh, I mean I guess I\&#39;m a pretty sick guy.&#34; He\&#39;s smiling. &#34;So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry\&#39;s Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.&#34; He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen\&#39;s place, putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door, he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms, and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans, ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask, stunned. &#34;Are you my 2:00?&#34; asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Can I help you?&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m looking for Paul Allen\&#39;s place. Doesn\&#39;t he live here?&#34; &#34;No he doesn\&#39;t. Did you see the ad in the Times?&#34; &#34;No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times.&#34; &#34;There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now.&#34; He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble, and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. &#34;Don\&#39;t come back,&#34; she warns. &#34;I won\&#39;t. Don\&#39;t worry.&#34; He closes the door behind him.Outside, Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. &#34;Jean... I need help.&#34; He sounds distraught. &#34;Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called, he wants to meet you, Van Paten and Bryce at Harry\&#39;s Bar for drinks.&#34; &#34;What did you say you dumb bitch...&#34; he croaks. &#34;Patrick I can\&#39;t hear you.&#34; &#34;What am I doing?&#34; he laughs. &#34;Where are you Patrick? What\&#39;s wrong?&#34; He starts crying. &#34;I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;m going to... make it, Jean. To the uh, office, this afternoon.&#34; &#34;Why?&#34; She sounds worried. &#34;JUST... SAY... NO!&#34; he screams. &#34;What is it? Patrick, are you alright?&#34; &#34;Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS!&#34; he screams, laughing. He hangs up, then tries to compose himself.Jean goes to Patrick\&#39;s desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.Patrick reaches Harry\&#39;s Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce, Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. &#34;Rough day at the office?&#34; Bryce is drinking mineral water. &#34;He\&#39;s a changed man! But he still can\&#39;t get a reservation to save his life.&#34; Bateman tells them he isn\&#39;t going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer, Harold Carnes, across the room, and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the \&#39;90s. &#34;Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So uh, did you get my message?&#34; &#34;Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you, wasn\&#39;t it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That\&#39;s fabulous. That\&#39;s rich.&#34; He asks him what he means. &#34;The message you left. By the way Davis, how\&#39;s Cynthia? You\&#39;re still seeing her, right?&#34; &#34;What do you mean?&#34; &#34;Nothing. It\&#39;s good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?&#34; He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. &#34;Davis. I\&#39;m not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce, or McDermott, otherwise it was amusing. Now if you\&#39;ll excuse me, I really must be going.&#34; For some odd reason, Carnes keeps calling Patrick &#34;Davis&#34;. Patrick angrily stops him again. &#34;I did it, Carnes! I killed him! I\&#39;m Patrick Bateman! I chopped Allen\&#39;s fucking head off,&#34; he whispers with tears in his eyes. &#34;The whole message I left on your machine was true.&#34; Carnes tries to leave again. &#34;No! Listen, don\&#39;t you know who I am? I\&#39;m not Davis, I\&#39;m Patrick Bateman!&#34; He no longer sounds sure who he is. &#34;We talk on the phone all the time. Don\&#39;t you recognize me? You\&#39;re my lawyer.&#34; He tells Carnes to listen carefully. &#34;I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it. I can\&#39;t make myself any clearer.&#34; Carnes tells him that that isn\&#39;t possible. &#34;And I don\&#39;t find this funny anymore.&#34; &#34;It never was supposed to be! Why isn\&#39;t it possible?&#34; &#34;It\&#39;s just not.&#34; &#34;Why not you stupid bastard?&#34; says Patrick. &#34;Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice, just ten days ago.&#34; &#34;No you... didn\&#39;t.&#34; Patrick is stunned. He begins to doubt whether he actually killed Allen or not or all those other people. Maybe it was all a fantasy. Maybe Patrick Bateman\&#39;s real name is Davis. Carnes excuses himself again and he lets him go.Jean continues to look with horror through Patrick\&#39;s notebook. A crude drawing of a woman getting her limbs cut off with a chainsaw. A naked woman nailed to boards. The more pages she turns, the worse the images get. Page after page is filled with shocking fantasies of rape, murder and mutilation of women.Patrick returns to the table. The guys are watching President Ronald Reagan talking about Iran-Contra on TV. &#34;How can he lie like that?&#34; says Bryce. Van Paten continues to ask where they have reservations, even though he isn\&#39;t really hungry. &#34;How can he be so fucking... I don\&#39;t know, cool about it?&#34; &#34;Some guys are just born cool I guess,&#34; says Van Paten. Bateman starts laughing. &#34;Bateman? What are you so fucking zany about?&#34; &#34;Ha ha, I\&#39;m just a happy camper! Rockin\&#39; and a-rollin\&#39;!&#34; Turning back to Reagan on the TV, Bryce says &#34;He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside... but inside...&#34; &#34;But inside doesn\&#39;t matter,&#34;A baffled Bateman narrates: &#34;Inside, yes? Inside? Believe it or not Bryce, we\&#39;re actually listening to you,&#34; says McDermott. Bryce asks Bateman what he thinks. &#34;Whatever.&#34; Van Paten says he doesn\&#39;t like dry beers and needs a scotch. Bateman looks over the faces of the people in the room as he narrates. &#34;There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others, and no one to escape. My punishment continues to elude me. My confession has meant nothing.&#34;&#39;, rating=&#39;7.6&#39;, release_date=&#39;2000-04-14&#39;, movie_id=&#39;tt0144084&#39;)</pre>

Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries, then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes, most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens, and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City, sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce, a Wall Street financial institution, are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas), David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says &#34;This is a chick&#39;s restaurant. Why aren&#39;t we at Dorsia?&#34; McDermott replies &#34;Because Bateman won&#39;t give the maitre d&#39; head.&#34; Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant, including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there&#39;s no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account, which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. &#34;Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?&#34; says Patrick. &#34;I&#39;ve seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah.&#34; Bateman rebukes him. &#34;Not a menorah. A dreidel, you spin a dreidel.&#34; McDermott replies &#34;Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?&#34; &#34;No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.&#34; &#34;Oh I forgot. Bateman&#39;s dating someone from the ACLU!&#34; Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks &#34;Speaking of reasonable, only $570.&#34; They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub, Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag, who lets them inside. As some 80&#39;s pop music plays from overhead, the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket, but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays, and then when she&#39;s out of earshot, he says &#34;You&#39;re a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, then play around with your blood.&#34; He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman&#39;s apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white, with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated, but looks expensive. &#34;I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street, on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I&#39;m 27 years old.&#34; He describes his diet and exercise routine, and his meticulous daily grooming rituals, which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. &#34;There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,&#34; he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. &#34;Some kind of abstraction. But there is no &#39;real me&#39;. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.&#34;Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York, the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office, Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says &#34;Hey Hamilton. Nice tan.&#34; Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), to his office door. She&#39;s dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. &#34;Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?&#34; She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled, but she doesn&#39;t know what he cancelled or why. &#34;I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club.&#34; She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. &#34;What should I say?&#34; &#34;Just say no.&#34; He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch, as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. &#34;Something romantic?&#34; &#34;No, silly. Forget it. I&#39;ll make them. Just get me a mineral water.&#34; She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her, he tells her not to wear that outfit. &#34;Wear a dress or a skirt. You&#39;re prettier than that.&#34; The phone starts ringing, and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn&#39;t there. &#34;And high heels.&#34; She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside, Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones, but his &#34;supposed&#34; fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can&#39;t take the time off work to get married. &#34;Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. You hate that job anyway, I don&#39;t see why you don&#39;t just quit.&#34; &#34;Because... I want... to fit... IN.&#34; The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. &#34;I&#39;m on the verge of tears as we arrive, since I&#39;m positive we won&#39;t have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me, in an awesome wave.&#34; Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. &#34;This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash,&#34; says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks, and then starts kissing her neck, slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi, he remarks &#34;I&#39;m fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know.&#34; Bateman doesn&#39;t care because he&#39;s also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her best friend. &#34;She&#39;s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs, tonight I believe it&#39;s Xanax.&#34; She&#39;s also engaged to Luis Carruthers, &#34;the biggest doofus in the business.&#34; Courtney and Luis are seated beside him, and Courtney, slurring her words, asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. &#34;Yes. I read that,&#34; says Luis. &#34;Oh who gives a rat&#39;s ass,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;That affects us,&#34; says Vanden. &#34;What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Don&#39;t you know that the Sikhs are killing like, tons of Israelis over there?&#34; Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid, nuclear arms, terrorism, and world hunger. &#34;We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, and less materialism in young people.&#34; Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. &#34;Patrick, how thought-provoking,&#34; Luis says, feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It&#39;s nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says &#34;hello&#34;. She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day, Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can&#39;t bleach that type of sheet, and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can&#39;t understand. &#34;Lady, if you don&#39;t shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.&#34; She is shocked, but still won&#39;t speak English. &#34;I can&#39;t understand you! You&#39;re a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!&#34; A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. &#34;It&#39;s so silly to come all the way up here,&#34; she says, &#34;but they really are the best.&#34; &#34;Then why can&#39;t they get these stains out?&#34; he says, showing her the sheets. &#34;Can you get through to them? I&#39;m getting nowhere.&#34; &#34;What are those?&#34; she says, looking wide-eyed at the stains. &#34;Uh, well it&#39;s cranberry juice. Cran-apple.&#34; She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes, and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he&#39;s booked solid. &#34;What about Saturday?&#34; &#34;Next Saturday? Can&#39;t. Matinee of Les Mis.&#34; He promises to call her, and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear, on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. &#34;You&#39;re dating Luis, he&#39;s in Arizona. You&#39;re fucking me and we haven&#39;t made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?&#34; She says she&#39;s waiting for Luis to call. &#34;Pumpkin you&#39;re dating an asshole. Pumpkin you&#39;re dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you&#39;re dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.&#34; She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner, and when she says no, he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant, and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo, Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day, while she is almost passing out from her medication. &#34;Is that Donald Trump&#39;s car?&#34; he asks, looking out the window. Patrick&#39;s face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium, or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. &#34;I just want a child,&#34; she says, absently looking out the window. &#34;Just two... perfect... children.&#34;At the restaurant, she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. &#34;Are we here?&#34; she asks sleepily. &#34;Yeah,&#34; he says, sitting down. &#34;This is Dorsia?&#34; &#34;Yes dear,&#34; he says, opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she&#39;s going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. &#34;New York Matinee called it a &#39;playful but mysterious little dish. You&#39;ll love it.&#34; He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him, and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&amp;P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. &#34;Dorsia, how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?&#34; &#34;Lucky I guess,&#34; replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. &#34;Valentino Couture?&#34; &#34;Uh-huh.&#34; Luis tries to touch it, but Patrick slaps his hand away. &#34;Your compliment was sufficient Luis.&#34; Paul Allen comes up to them. &#34;Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?&#34; Narrating, Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for &#34;this dickhead Marcus Halberstram.&#34; They both work at P&amp;P and do the same exact work, and wear the same glasses and suits. &#34;Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut.&#34; Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia, Marcus&#39; girlfriend. &#34;She&#39;s great, I&#39;m very lucky,&#34; replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in, congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. &#34;Thank you, Baxter.&#34; Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. &#34;Call me.&#34; &#34;How about Friday?&#34; says Bryce. &#34;No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche.&#34; He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he&#39;s lying. Bateman takes out his new business card, which reads &#34;Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President&#34;. &#34;What do you think?&#34; &#34;Very nice,&#34; says McDermott. &#34;I picked them up from the printers yesterday.&#34; &#34;Nice coloring,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;That&#39;s &#39;bone&#39;. And the lettering is something called &#39;silian rail&#39;.&#34; &#34;Cool Bateman. But that&#39;s nothing,&#34; says Van Paten, laying his card down next to Patrick&#39;s. &#34;That is really nice,&#34; says Bryce. &#34;Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?&#34; Van Paten asks Patrick. &#34;Nice,&#34; Patrick says, visibly jealous. &#34;How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?&#34; says Bryce. Biting his nails, Patrick can&#39;t believe Bryce prefers Van Paten&#39;s card. &#34;You ain&#39;t seen nothing yet,&#34; says Bryce, taking out his own card. &#34;Raised lettering, pale nimbus, white.&#34; Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage, Bateman tells him it&#39;s very nice. &#34;Let&#39;s see Paul Allen&#39;s card.&#34; Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room, even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating, Patrick says &#34;Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!&#34; He drops the card on the table. &#34;Something wrong?&#34; asks Luis. &#34;Patrick? You&#39;re sweating.&#34;Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley, a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him, to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. &#34;Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?&#34; He starts taking out some money. &#34;I&#39;m hungry,&#34; says the bum. &#34;It&#39;s cold out too isn&#39;t it? If you&#39;re so hungry, why don&#39;t you get a job?&#34; The bum says he lost his job. &#34;Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking.&#34; He asks him his name, and the bum says his name is Al. &#34;Get a god-damn job, Al! You have a negative attitude. That&#39;s what&#39;s stopping you.&#34; He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he&#39;s a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick&#39;s arm, and Patrick pulls it off, visibly disgusted. &#34;You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?&#34; He laughs, and then apologizes. &#34;I don&#39;t have anything in common with you.&#34; He bends down and opens his briefcase. &#34;Oh thank you mister, thank you. It&#39;s cold out here...&#34; &#34;You know what a fucking loser you are?&#34; Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach, than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick, so he stomps it with his foot, hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick&#39;s face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later, another Asian woman gives him a manicure. &#34;I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed, and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me, and I don&#39;t know why.&#34; He is lying in a tanning bed now. &#34;My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.&#34;A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. &#39;Deck The Halls&#39; is playing in the background. Patrick takes one, scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. &#34;Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas,&#34; says Patrick. &#34;Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?&#34; He points to Paul Allen across the room. &#34;Of course. Who else?&#34; Evelyn comes up to them. &#34;Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You&#39;re late honey.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve been here the entire time, you just didn&#39;t see me.&#34; A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick&#39;s head without him noticing. &#34;Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says &#39;hello Patrick&#39;&#34;, she says in a childish voice. &#34;What is it?&#34; Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. &#34;It&#39;s a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t you?&#34; Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. &#34;Stop scowling Patrick. You&#39;re such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don&#39;t say breast implants again.&#34; Ignoring her, he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. &#39;Joy to the World&#39; is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. &#34;Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas, how&#39;ve you been. Workaholic I suppose?&#34; He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell&#39;s bar, and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. &#34;Cecilia would adore it.&#34; &#34;Then let&#39;s do it, Marcus.&#34; Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party, and then walks away. &#34;Why is he calling you Marcus?&#34; asks Evelyn. Ignoring this, Patrick says &#34;Mistletoe alert!&#34;, and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated, and he is arguing with a waiter. &#34;I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty.&#34; Patrick ignores this and orders a J&amp;B straight and a Corona. The waiter, who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck, starts to list the specials, but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. &#34;Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?&#34; &#34;Not if you want to keep your spleen,&#34; says Patrick. The waiter leaves. &#34;This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot, very hot,&#34; Paul comments sarcastically. &#34;The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here,&#34; replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. &#34;I&#39;m a child of divorce, give me a break. I see they&#39;ve omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o.&#34; Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. &#34;Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?&#34; Patrick says, looking behind him. &#34;Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?&#34; He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. &#34;Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I&#39;d have to kill ya!&#34; He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says &#34;I like to dissect girls. Did you know I&#39;m utterly insane?&#34; Paul doesn&#39;t seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon, Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. &#34;You should look into it.&#34; Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. &#34;I think she&#39;s having dinner with Evelyn Williams.&#34; &#34;Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman, what a dork!&#34; Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. &#34;Another martini Paul?&#34;Patrick&#39;s apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. &#34;Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?&#34; &#34;They&#39;re OK,&#34; says Paul. Patrick continues &#34;Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when &#39;Sports&#39; came out in &#39;83, I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically.&#34; He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. &#34;The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism, that really gives the songs a big boost!&#34; He takes a valium, washes it down, looks at himself in the mirror, and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards, he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello, but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. &#34;Hey Halberstram,&#34; says Paul. &#34;Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?&#34; He laughs. &#34;No Allen.&#34; &#34;Is that a raincoat?&#34; &#34;Yes it is!&#34; He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song &#39;Hip to Be Square&#39; starts playing. &#34;In &#39;87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is &#39;Hip to Be Square&#39;.&#34; He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. &#34;The song is so catchy, most people probably don&#39;t listen to the lyrics, but they should, because it&#39;s not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it&#39;s also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!&#34; Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming, he swings it into Paul&#39;s head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor, pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells &#34;Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!&#34; He swings it down again, and again, screaming, decapitating him. &#34;You... fucking... bastard!&#34; He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. &#39;Hip to Be Square&#39; continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him, and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside, and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It&#39;s Luis. &#34;Patrick. Is that you?&#34; &#34;No Luis. It&#39;s not me. You&#39;re mistaken.&#34; He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. &#34;We&#39;re going to Nell&#39;s. Gwendolyn&#39;s father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?&#34; He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. &#34;Jean-Paul Gaultier.&#34; Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later, he arrives at Paul&#39;s apartment. &#34;I almost panic when I realize that Paul&#39;s place overlooks the park, and is obviously more expensive than mine.&#34; He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. &#34;It&#39;s time for Paul to take a little trip.&#34; He throws some clothes in a suitcase, and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul&#39;s voice, he records &#34;It&#39;s Paul. I&#39;ve been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I&#39;ll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.&#34; He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day, Patrick listens to the song &#39;The Lady in Red&#39; by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there&#39;s someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. &#34;Who?&#34; &#34;Detective Donald Kimball.&#34; He looks through the office window. &#34;Tell him I&#39;m at lunch.&#34; &#34;Patrick, it&#39;s only 10:30. I think he knows you&#39;re here.&#34; &#34;Send him in, I guess,&#34; he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone, giving him advice on clothes and salons. &#34;Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I&#39;ve gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh, just joking. No, don&#39;t tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it.&#34; He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. &#34;No I&#39;m sorry, I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?&#34; Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. &#34;Mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.&#34; They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. &#34;So, what&#39;s the topic of discussion?&#34; Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. &#34;I just have some basic questions.&#34; Patrick offers him coffee, which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water, which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. &#34;It&#39;s no problem.&#34; He asks what the topic of discussion is again, and Kimball repeats he&#39;s investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle, and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn&#39;t heard anything. &#34;I think his family wants this kept quiet.&#34; &#34;Understandable. Lime?&#34; offers Bateman. Kimball insists he&#39;s ok. He asks Patrick his age, where he went to school, and his address, the American Gardens building, which Kimball says is very nice. &#34;Thanks,&#34; Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. &#34;I&#39;m at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing.&#34; Kimball asks him what he means. &#34;Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.&#34; Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. &#34;I hope I&#39;m not being cross-examined here.&#34; &#34;You feel like that?&#34; &#34;No. Not really.&#34; Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. &#34;He had a yacht?&#34; &#34;No, he just hung out there.&#34; &#34;And where did he go to school?&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t you know this?&#34; &#34;I just wanted to know if you know.&#34; Patrick tells him St. Paul&#39;s, then says he just wants to help. &#34;I understand.&#34; Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine, and that Meredith doesn&#39;t think he went to London. &#34;Has anyone seen him in London?&#34; &#34;Actually, yes. But I&#39;m having a hard time getting actual verification.&#34; He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet, but Kimball says no. &#34;Basically, no-one&#39;s seen or heard anything. It&#39;s just strange. One day someone&#39;s walking around, going to work, alive, and then...&#34; &#34;Nothing.&#34; &#34;People just disappear,&#34; says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says &#34;The earth just... opens up and swallows them.&#34; &#34;Eerie. Really eerie.&#34; Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. &#34;The Four Seasons? Isn&#39;t that a little far up town? I mean, aren&#39;t you going to be late?&#34; &#34;No, there&#39;s one down here.&#34; Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything, and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat, a hooker, stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she&#39;s been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you around here,&#34; he tells her. &#34;Well you just haven&#39;t been looking.&#34; &#34;Would you like to see my apartment?&#34; She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. &#34;I&#39;m not supposed to, but I can make an exception,&#34; she says, taking the money. &#34;Do you take a credit card? Just joking.&#34; He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. &#34;I&#39;d like a girl, early 20&#39;s, blonde, who does couples. And I really can&#39;t stress blonde enough. Blonde.&#34; He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen, and that he&#39;s going to call her Christie. &#34;You&#39;ll respond only to Christie, is that clear?&#34; She nods.Patrick&#39;s apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub, where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. &#34;That&#39;s a very fine chardonnay you&#39;re drinking.&#34; The song &#39;If You Don&#39;t Know Me by Now&#39; is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. &#34;I want you to clean your vagina,&#34; he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. &#34;From behind. Get on your knees.&#34; He tells her she has a nice body, playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It&#39;s the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe, then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl, and takes her coat. &#34;I&#39;m Paul. Not quite blonde, are you? More like dirty blonde. I&#39;m going to call you Sabrina. I&#39;m Paul Allen.&#34; He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no, lewdly. &#34;Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?&#34; Sabrina shakes her head, and Patrick clenches his jaw. &#34;You have a really nice place here Paul,&#34; says Christie. &#34;How much did you pay for it?&#34; &#34;Well actually Christie, that&#39;s none of your business. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn&#39;t cheap.&#34; Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. &#34;No! No smoking in here.&#34; He offers them chocolate truffles. &#34;I don&#39;t want to get you drunk, but uh, that&#39;s a very fine chardonnay you&#39;re not drinking.&#34; He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. &#34;I&#39;ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, &#39;Duke&#39;. Before that, I really didn&#39;t understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin&#39;s presence became more apparent.&#34; He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom, invitingly. &#34;I think Invisible Touch is the group&#39;s undisputed masterpiece.&#34; The girls follow him into the bedroom. &#34;It&#39;s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.&#34; He tells Christie to take off the robe, which she does. &#34;Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument,&#34; he says, setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. &#34;In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don&#39;t you dance a little? Take the lyrics to &#39;Land of Confusion&#39;. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. &#39;In Too Deep&#39; is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,&#34; he continues, wrapping a scarf around Christie&#39;s neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. &#34;About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I&#39;ve heard in rock.&#34; He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. &#34;Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin&#39;s solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like &#39;In the Air Tonight&#39; and &#39;Against All Odds&#39;. Sabrina, don&#39;t just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word &#39;artist&#39;.&#34; He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. &#34;This is &#39;Sussudio&#39;, a great, great song. A personal favorite.&#34; He walks back to the bedroom, unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex, then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie&#39;s arm touches his. &#34;Don&#39;t touch the watch.&#34; He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors, carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. &#34;Can we go now?&#34; asks Christie. &#34;We&#39;re not through yet.&#34;Some time later, he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina&#39;s nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott, Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them, discussing women. &#34;If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, who fucking cares?&#34; says McDermott. &#34;Well let&#39;s just say hypothetically, what if they have a good personality?&#34; replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence, and then all three men burst out laughing. &#34;There are no girls with good personalities!&#34; they say in unison, high-fiving each other. Van Paten says &#34;A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.&#34; McDermott continues: &#34;The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks.&#34; Van Paten agrees. &#34;And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.&#34; Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: &#34;Ed Gein? Maitre d&#39; at Canal Bar?&#34; &#34;No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50&#39;s.&#34; &#34;What did Ed say?&#34; &#34;He said &#39;When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.&#39;&#34; McDermott: &#34;And what did the other part of him think?&#34; &#34;What her head would look like on a stick!&#34; Bateman laughs heartily, but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. &#34;Is that all you ever have to contribute?&#34; snaps Bateman. &#34;Fucking dinner?&#34; McDermott tells him to cheer up. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? No shiatsu this morning?&#34; Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. &#34;Do that again and you&#39;ll draw back a stub.&#34; McDermott tells him &#34;Hang on there little buddy,&#34; but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves, he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking, he slowly puts his fingers around Luis&#39; neck. Luis turns around, looks at Patrick&#39;s hands, takes off one of his gloves, and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. &#34;God. Patrick, why here?&#34; Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can&#39;t bring himself to kill Luis. &#34;I&#39;ve seen you looking at me. I&#39;ve noticed your... hot body,&#34; Luis says, rubbing a finger over Patrick&#39;s mouth. &#34;Don&#39;t be shy. You can&#39;t imagine how long I&#39;ve wanted this, ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie...&#34; Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands, with his gloves still on. He looks like he&#39;s about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. &#34;I want you. I want you too!&#34; Patrick starts walking towards the door. &#34;Patrick?&#34; &#34;WHAT IS IT?&#34; he yells. &#34;Where are you going?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve got to return some videotapes.&#34;He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs, he sees Luis make a &#39;call me&#39; gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean&#39;s desk, talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. &#34;I&#39;ve been wanting to talk with you, come into my office,&#34; Patrick says, shaking his hand. &#34;Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?&#34;Inside his office. &#34;Do you remember where you were the night of Paul&#39;s disappearance?&#34; asks Kimball. &#34;Which was on the 20th of December.&#34; &#34;God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes.&#34; He looks at his datebook. &#34;I had a date with a girl named Veronica.&#34; &#34;That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve got,&#34; says Kimball. &#34;What?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s not the information I&#39;ve received.&#34; &#34;What information have you received? I could be wrong.&#34; &#34;When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?&#34; &#34;We&#39;d gone to a new musical called &#39;Oh Africa, Brave Africa&#39;. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I&#39;ve been informative. Long day. I&#39;m a bit scattered.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so, when I&#39;ve sorted out all of this information?&#34; Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. &#34;Absolutely. I&#39;m with you on that one.&#34; Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. &#34;Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?&#34; Patrick is stunned, and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. &#34;Never. I mean I don&#39;t really like singers.&#34; &#34;Not a big music fan, huh?&#34; &#34;No I like music, just they&#39;re... Huey&#39;s too black sounding for me.&#34; &#34;To each his own.&#34; Kimball closes his briefcase. &#34;So, lunch next week?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms, then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself, putting it on Courtney&#39;s lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. &#34;Will you call me before Easter?&#34; she asks. &#34;Maybe.&#34; &#34;What are you doing tonight?&#34; &#34;Dinner at uh, River Cafe.&#34; &#34;That&#39;s nice,&#34; she says, lighting a cigarette. &#34;I never knew you smoked.&#34; &#34;You never noticed. Listen, Patrick, can we talk?&#34; &#34;You look... marvelous. There&#39;s nothing to say,&#34; he says, shutting her out. &#34;You&#39;re going to marry Luis.&#34; &#34;Isn&#39;t that special... Patrick? If I don&#39;t see you before Easter, have a nice one okay?&#34; she asks, with a hint of depression in her voice. &#34;You too.&#34; He starts to leave. &#34;Patrick?&#34; &#34;Yeah?&#34; &#34;Nothing...&#34; He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song &#39;Pump up the Volume&#39; is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. &#34;There&#39;s this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected, you can catch anything. Alzheimer&#39;s, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia!&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure but I don&#39;t think dyslexia is a disease,&#34; says Bateman. &#34;But who knows? They don&#39;t know that. Prove it.&#34; Bryce snorts some white powder. &#34;Oh God. It&#39;s a fucking milligram of sweetener.&#34; Patrick sniffs some. &#34;I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we&#39;ll be okay,&#34; says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. &#34;Could you keep it down? I&#39;m trying to do drugs!&#34; &#34;Fuck you!&#34; says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. &#34;We&#39;ll do it anyway.&#34; &#34;That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it&#39;s okay!&#34; &#34;Fuck you!&#34; says the man. &#34;Fuck YOU!&#34; says Bryce. &#34;Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let&#39;s do it.&#34;A club balcony. The song &#39;What&#39;s On Your Mind&#39; is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. &#34;He&#39;s the one behind Glasnost.&#34; Bryce makes a &#39;he went to get cocaine&#39; gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. &#34;I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions,&#34; she says. &#34;You&#39;re not confused are you?&#34; asks Bryce. &#34;No, not really.&#34; Another woman says &#34;Gorbachev is NOT downstairs.&#34; &#34;Karen&#39;s right, Gorbachev is not down stairs. He&#39;s at Tunnel.&#34; Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. &#34;So what do you do?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m into uh, well murders and executions mostly.&#34; &#34;Do you like it?&#34; &#34;Well that depends, why?&#34; &#34;Well most guys I know, who work in mergers and acquisitions, really don&#39;t like it.&#34; He asks her where she works out.On the street, Patrick and the girl are talking. &#34;You think I&#39;m dumb don&#39;t you. You think all models are dumb.&#34; &#34;No. I really don&#39;t.&#34; &#34;That&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t mind. There&#39;s something sweet about you.&#34; They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door, and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly, wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. &#34;Doin&#39; the crossword?&#34; she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either &#39;meat&#39; or &#39;bones&#39;. She asks him if he needs any help, but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door, he says &#34;Jean, would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you&#39;re not doing anything.&#34; She says she doesn&#39;t have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. &#34;Well! Isn&#39;t this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go?&#34; She says she doesn&#39;t care where. &#34;How about anywhere you want?&#34; he tells her. &#34;I don&#39;t know Patrick, I can&#39;t make this decision.&#34; &#34;Come on!&#34; he says, chuckling and pointing his pen at her. &#34;Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere.&#34; She thinks for a minute. &#34;How about...&#34; Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. &#34;Dorsia?&#34; Patrick looks up. &#34;So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t know, we&#39;ll go wherever you want to go.&#34; &#34;Dorsia is fine.&#34; He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. &#34;Dorsia, yes?&#34; says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at, oh, say nine o&#39;clock?&#34; &#34;We&#39;re totally booked.&#34; &#34;Really? That&#39;s great.&#34; &#34;No I said we are totally booked!&#34; &#34;Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!&#34; He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. &#34;Yeah?&#34; he asks, taking off his sunglasses. &#34;You&#39;re... dressed okay.&#34; &#34;You didn&#39;t give a name.&#34; &#34;They know me,&#34; he lies. &#34;Why don&#39;t you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?&#34; She smiles and starts to leave. &#34;And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.&#34;Jean looks out the window of Patrick&#39;s place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She&#39;s dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. &#34;Patrick it&#39;s so elegant. What a wonderful view.&#34; Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. &#34;Jean, sorbet?&#34; &#34;Thanks Patrick. I&#39;d love some.&#34; He gives it to her. &#34;Do you want a bite?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m on a diet, but thank you,&#34; he says. &#34;No need to lose any weight. You&#39;re kidding right? You look great,&#34; she tells him. &#34;Very fit.&#34; &#34;You can always be thinner... look better.&#34; &#34;Well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t go out to dinner. I don&#39;t want to ruin your willpower.&#34; &#34;That&#39;s alright. I&#39;m not very good at controlling it anyway.&#34; He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. &#34;So, what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don&#39;t tell me you enjoy working with children.&#34; She tells him she&#39;d like to travel and maybe go back to school. &#34;I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities.&#34; Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. &#34;I&#39;m just so unsure.&#34; He asks her if she has a boyfriend. &#34;No, not really.&#34; &#34;Interesting.&#34; &#34;Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?&#34; she asks. &#34;Maybe. I don&#39;t know. Not really,&#34; he says with a smile. &#34;Jean, do you feel, fulfilled? I mean, in your life?&#34; &#34;I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I&#39;ve really begun to think about changing myself, developing and growing.&#34; Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. &#34;Growing. I&#39;m glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy&#39;s first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?&#34; he laughs. &#34;Who&#39;s Ted Bundy?&#34; &#34;Forget it.&#34; &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; &#34;Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.&#34; &#34;Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?&#34; She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. &#34;No! Put it in the carton!&#34; &#34;Sorry.&#34; He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. &#34;I&#39;m looking for uh...&#34; He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. &#34;I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.&#34; His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings, and the answering machine picks it up. It&#39;s Evelyn. &#34;Patrick... Patrick! I know you&#39;re there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?&#34; He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. &#34;It&#39;s me. Don&#39;t try to hide. I hope you&#39;re not out there with some number you picked up because you&#39;re MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door.&#34; Jean sips some wine, looking at Patrick as she listens. &#34;Anyway you never called me and you said you would, and I&#39;ll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you, but we&#39;re having dinner with Melania and Taylor, you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we&#39;re meeting at the Cornell club. So I&#39;ll see you tomorrow morning honey!&#34; Patrick winces. &#34;Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye.&#34; She hangs up. Jean says &#34;Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?&#34; He doesn&#39;t answer. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?&#34; &#34;Yeah,&#34; he finally says. &#34;I don&#39;t think I can control myself.&#34; &#34;I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.&#34; She asks him if he wants her to go. &#34;I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don&#39;t want to get hurt, do you?&#34; &#34;No, I guess not. I don&#39;t want to get bruised.&#34; She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out, she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. &#34;Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.&#34;A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other, eating some beef dishes. &#34;So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?&#34; asks Kimball. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. Uh, I had a shower, and some sorbet?&#34; &#34;I think you&#39;re getting your dates mixed up.&#34; &#34;Well, where do you place Paul that night?&#34; He tells Patrick that according to his datebook, Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram, thought Marcus denied it. &#34;Does Marcus have an alibi?&#34; &#34;Yes. I&#39;ve checked it out, it&#39;s clean. Now, where were you?&#34; &#34;Well, where was Marcus?&#34; &#34;He wasn&#39;t with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Fredrick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner, and... you.&#34; Patrick looks up. &#34;Oh right, yeah, of course.&#34; Kimball makes a &#39;slipped your mind&#39; gesture. &#34;We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.&#34; Kimball says &#34;Personally, I think the guy just went a little nutso, split town for a while, maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn&#39;t that right Patrick?&#34; he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She&#39;s standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. &#34;I&#39;m not so sure about this,&#34; she tells him. &#34;I had to go to emergency last time.&#34; He promises that this won&#39;t be anything like last time. She says no. &#34;Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You&#39;ll be safe.&#34; He holds out some money. Reluctantly, she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. &#34;Nothing like last time. I promise,&#34; he repeats. &#34;Alright.&#34; He tells her she&#39;s looking great, and asks how she&#39;s been. &#34;I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.&#34; &#34;Lawyers are so complicated,&#34; he says, writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her, waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it, but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again, moving over to let her get back in. &#34;Half now, half later.&#34; He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again, and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. &#34;She&#39;ll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You&#39;ll like her. She&#39;s a very nice girl.&#34;Paul Allen&#39;s apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon, and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. &#34;Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar, didn&#39;t I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar.&#34; She talks on and on in a self-important tone, neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. &#34;It&#39;s not that nice,&#34; he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. &#34;You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number.&#34; &#34;What do you mean? She was a hot number.&#34; &#34;If you had a platinum card she&#39;d give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon, need I say more?&#34; She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. &#34;She&#39;s my... cousin. She&#39;s from... France,&#34; says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she&#39;s calling doesn&#39;t answer. &#34;Elizabeth, it&#39;s 3 in the morning.&#34; &#34;He&#39;s a god damn drug dealer, these are his peak hours.&#34; She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can&#39;t remember where she is. &#34;Paul Allen&#39;s.&#34; &#34;I want the number idiot. Anyway I&#39;m at Paul Norman&#39;s and I&#39;ll try you again later, and if I don&#39;t see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I&#39;m going to sic my hairdresser on you.&#34; She hangs up. &#34;Did you know that guy who disappeared, didn&#39;t he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?&#34; He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. &#34;Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon.&#34; &#34;Listen,&#34; he says. &#34;I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*.&#34; They stare at him. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with that? It&#39;s totally disease-free.&#34; &#34;Patrick you&#39;re a lunatic.&#34; He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. &#34;Let&#39;s not get lewd. I&#39;m in no mood for lewd conversation.&#34; He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. &#34;You&#39;re telling me you&#39;ve never gotten it on with a girl?&#34; he asks Elizabeth. &#34;No. I&#39;m not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?&#34; &#34;Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.&#34; &#34;Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS, Patrick. You&#39;re making me feel weird.&#34;Some time later, the drugs having kicked in, and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully &#34;Did you know that Whitney Houston&#39;s debut LP, called simply &#39;Whitney Houston&#39;, had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?&#34; Elizabeth starts laughing. &#34;You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?&#34; she laughs, falling off the couch. &#34;It&#39;s hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But &#39;The Greatest Love of All&#39; is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written, about self-preservation, dignity, its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it&#39;s not too late to better ourselves.&#34; Elizabeth is still laughing. &#34;Since, Elizabeth, it&#39;s impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, but we can always empathize with ourselves. It&#39;s an important message, crucial really, and it&#39;s beautifully stated on the album.&#34;All three have sex, Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth&#39;s torso, and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets, and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room, and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open, to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick&#39;s existence finally revealed to her, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words &#39;DIE YUPPIE SCUM&#39; and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead, naked woman. Patrick runs in, covered in Elizabeth&#39;s blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. &#34;Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!&#34; She runs through the living room and out into the hallway, pounding and screaming on neighbours&#39; doors, but to no avail. Patrick runs after her, stark nude, and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap, waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom, he lets go, and the chainsaw falls end over end, finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn&#39;t touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him, asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. &#34;I think Evelyn, that uh, we&#39;ve lost touch.&#34; &#34;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asks, waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her, and she mouths &#34;It&#39;s beautiful. I love it.&#34; &#34;My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It&#39;s over, it&#39;s all over,&#34; he tells her, scratching a red X over his drawing. &#34;Touchy touchy. I&#39;m sorry I brought up the wedding. Let&#39;s just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m fucking serious. It&#39;s fucking over, us, this is no joke, uh, I don&#39;t think we should see each other any more.&#34; &#34;But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends. I really don&#39;t think it would work.&#34; She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth, but her stops her. &#34;I know that your friends are my friends, and I&#39;ve thought about that. You can have &#39;em.&#34; She finally understands. &#34;You&#39;re really serious, aren&#39;t you? What about the past? Our past?&#34; &#34;We never really shared one,&#34; he replies. &#34;You&#39;re inhuman.&#34; &#34;No. I&#39;m-I&#39;m in touch with humanity.&#34; She starts crying. &#34;Evelyn I&#39;m sorry, I just uh... you&#39;re not terribly important to me.&#34; She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. &#34;I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes...&#34; &#34;What is it that you want?&#34; she cries. &#34;If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!&#34; he snaps. &#34;Oh God I can&#39;t believe this,&#34; she weeps. &#34;I&#39;m leaving,&#34; he says. &#34;I&#39;ve assessed the situation and I&#39;m leaving.&#34; &#34;But where are you going?&#34; &#34;I have to return some videotapes.&#34;Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. &#34;Here kitty kitty.&#34; He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: &#39;FEED ME A STRAY CAT&#39;. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM, but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat&#39;s head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. &#34;Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!&#34; He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away, and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car, but every car on the street is locked, and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out, guns drawn. &#34;Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!&#34; He starts to put his hands up, then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover, firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots, and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck, he looks at the gun, then at his watch, and walks away. He breaks into a run, under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. &#34;Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Don&#39;t forget to sign in,&#34; says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door, back into the lobby, shoots the janitor, then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat, he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen, signs in, and goes up in the elevator, crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window, then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying, he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. &#34;Harold, it&#39;s Bateman. You&#39;re my lawyer so I think you should know, I&#39;ve killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10, um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man, some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can&#39;t remember maybe a model, but she&#39;s dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell&#39;s Kitchen. I don&#39;t want to leave anything out here. I guess I&#39;ve killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um...&#34; He almost can&#39;t say it. &#34;I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little.&#34; He starts laughing. &#34;Tonight I, uh, hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!&#34; Crying again. &#34;And I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m gonna get away with it this time. I guess I&#39;ll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I&#39;m a pretty uh, I mean I guess I&#39;m a pretty sick guy.&#34; He&#39;s smiling. &#34;So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry&#39;s Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.&#34; He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen&#39;s place, putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door, he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms, and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans, ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask, stunned. &#34;Are you my 2:00?&#34; asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Can I help you?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m looking for Paul Allen&#39;s place. Doesn&#39;t he live here?&#34; &#34;No he doesn&#39;t. Did you see the ad in the Times?&#34; &#34;No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times.&#34; &#34;There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now.&#34; He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble, and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. &#34;Don&#39;t come back,&#34; she warns. &#34;I won&#39;t. Don&#39;t worry.&#34; He closes the door behind him.Outside, Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. &#34;Jean... I need help.&#34; He sounds distraught. &#34;Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called, he wants to meet you, Van Paten and Bryce at Harry&#39;s Bar for drinks.&#34; &#34;What did you say you dumb bitch...&#34; he croaks. &#34;Patrick I can&#39;t hear you.&#34; &#34;What am I doing?&#34; he laughs. &#34;Where are you Patrick? What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He starts crying. &#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to... make it, Jean. To the uh, office, this afternoon.&#34; &#34;Why?&#34; She sounds worried. &#34;JUST... SAY... NO!&#34; he screams. &#34;What is it? Patrick, are you alright?&#34; &#34;Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS!&#34; he screams, laughing. He hangs up, then tries to compose himself.Jean goes to Patrick&#39;s desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.Patrick reaches Harry&#39;s Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce, Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. &#34;Rough day at the office?&#34; Bryce is drinking mineral water. &#34;He&#39;s a changed man! But he still can&#39;t get a reservation to save his life.&#34; Bateman tells them he isn&#39;t going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer, Harold Carnes, across the room, and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the &#39;90s. &#34;Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So uh, did you get my message?&#34; &#34;Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you, wasn&#39;t it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That&#39;s fabulous. That&#39;s rich.&#34; He asks him what he means. &#34;The message you left. By the way Davis, how&#39;s Cynthia? You&#39;re still seeing her, right?&#34; &#34;What do you mean?&#34; &#34;Nothing. It&#39;s good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?&#34; He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. &#34;Davis. I&#39;m not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce, or McDermott, otherwise it was amusing. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I really must be going.&#34; For some odd reason, Carnes keeps calling Patrick &#34;Davis&#34;. Patrick angrily stops him again. &#34;I did it, Carnes! I killed him! I&#39;m Patrick Bateman! I chopped Allen&#39;s fucking head off,&#34; he whispers with tears in his eyes. &#34;The whole message I left on your machine was true.&#34; Carnes tries to leave again. &#34;No! Listen, don&#39;t you know who I am? I&#39;m not Davis, I&#39;m Patrick Bateman!&#34; He no longer sounds sure who he is. &#34;We talk on the phone all the time. Don&#39;t you recognize me? You&#39;re my lawyer.&#34; He tells Carnes to listen carefully. &#34;I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it. I can&#39;t make myself any clearer.&#34; Carnes tells him that that isn&#39;t possible. &#34;And I don&#39;t find this funny anymore.&#34; &#34;It never was supposed to be! Why isn&#39;t it possible?&#34; &#34;It&#39;s just not.&#34; &#34;Why not you stupid bastard?&#34; says Patrick. &#34;Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice, just ten days ago.&#34; &#34;No you... didn&#39;t.&#34; Patrick is stunned. He begins to doubt whether he actually killed Allen or not or all those other people. Maybe it was all a fantasy. Maybe Patrick Bateman&#39;s real name is Davis. Carnes excuses himself again and he lets him go.Jean continues to look with horror through Patrick&#39;s notebook. A crude drawing of a woman getting her limbs cut off with a chainsaw. A naked woman nailed to boards. The more pages she turns, the worse the images get. Page after page is filled with shocking fantasies of rape, murder and mutilation of women.Patrick returns to the table. The guys are watching President Ronald Reagan talking about Iran-Contra on TV. &#34;How can he lie like that?&#34; says Bryce. Van Paten continues to ask where they have reservations, even though he isn&#39;t really hungry. &#34;How can he be so fucking... I don&#39;t know, cool about it?&#34; &#34;Some guys are just born cool I guess,&#34; says Van Paten. Bateman starts laughing. &#34;Bateman? What are you so fucking zany about?&#34; &#34;Ha ha, I&#39;m just a happy camper! Rockin&#39; and a-rollin&#39;!&#34; Turning back to Reagan on the TV, Bryce says &#34;He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside... but inside...&#34; &#34;But inside doesn&#39;t matter,&#34;A baffled Bateman narrates: &#34;Inside, yes? Inside? Believe it or not Bryce, we&#39;re actually listening to you,&#34; says McDermott. Bryce asks Bateman what he thinks. &#34;Whatever.&#34; Van Paten says he doesn&#39;t like dry beers and needs a scotch. Bateman looks over the faces of the people in the room as he narrates. &#34;There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others, and no one to escape. My punishment continues to elude me. My confession has meant nothing.&#34;|7.6   |2000-04-14  |tt0144084|

wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep.Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.The KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime.The KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and restless. The KNIGHT&#39;S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius Block turns around.Behind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak.KNIGHT Who are you?DEATH I am Death.KNIGHT Have you come for me?DEATH I have been walking by your side for a long time.KNIGHT That I know.DEATH Are you prepared?KNIGHT
My body is frightened, but I am not.DEATH Well, there is no shame in that.The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place it around the KNIGHT&#39;S shoulders.KNIGHT Wait a moment.DEATH That&#39;s what they all say. I grant no reprieves.KNIGHT You play chess, don&#39;t you?A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH&#39;S eyes.DEATH How did you know that?KNIGHT I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.DEATH Yes, in fact I&#39;m quite a good chess player.KNIGHT But you can&#39;t be better than I am.The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces.DEATH Why do you want to play chess with me?KNIGHT I have my reasons.DEATH That is your privilege.KNIGHT The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT&#39;S hands; it contains a black pawn.KNIGHT You drew black!DEATH Very appropriate. Don&#39;t you think so?The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, Antonius Block opens with his king&#39;s pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king&#39;s pawn.The morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has ceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day is already scorchingly hot.The squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack.The KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and up towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire. JONS soon overtakes him.JONS (sings)
Between a strumpet&#39;s legs to lie Is the life for which I sigh.He stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn&#39;t heard JON&#39;S song, or he pretends that he hasn&#39;t. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS sings even louder.JONS (sings)
Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.JONS finally gets the KNIGHT&#39;S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his horse, JONS&#39;S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn&#39;t made them any cleaner. They ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.JONS In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.
The KNIGHT doesn&#39;t answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, wagging its tail.JONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. When he doesn&#39;t receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake. He bends over the sleeping man&#39;s shoulder, but quickly pulls back his hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth.JONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight.KNIGHT Well, did he show you the way?JONS Not exactly.KNIGHT What did he say?JONS Nothing.KNIGHT Was he a mute?JONS No, sir, I wouldn&#39;t say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.KNIGHT Oh?JONS He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.
(sings)
One moment you&#39;re bright and lively, The next you&#39;re crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.KNIGHT Must you sing?JONS No.The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses&#39; hooves. They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the KNIGHT&#39;S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road.In his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of JOF&#39;S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, snores loudly.JOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse.JOF Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can&#39;t eat grass, worse luck. Can&#39;t you teach me how? We&#39;re a little hard up. People aren&#39;t very interested in juggling in this part of the country.He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble.JOF&#39;S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF&#39;S smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies.JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.JOF Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I&#39;ve just seen something. I&#39;ve got to tell you about it!MIA (sits up, terrified)
What is it? What&#39;s happened?JOF Listen, I&#39;ve had a vision. No, it wasn&#39;t a vision. It was real, absolutely real.MIA Oh, so you&#39;ve had a vision again!MIA&#39;s voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders.JOF But I did see her!MIA Whom did you see?JOF The Virgin Mary.MIA can&#39;t help being impressed by her husband&#39;s fervor. She lowers her voice.MIA Did you really see her?JOF She was so close to me that I could have touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand ...MIA What an imagination you have.JOF You don&#39;t believe me! But it was real, I tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.MIA
Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.JOF (embarrassed)
Why must you keep bringing that up?MIA
And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.JOF Well, perhaps that time I made it up. (eagerly) I did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The ones that I didn&#39;t make up.MIA (severely)
You have to keep your visions under control.
Otherwise people will think that you&#39;re a half-wit, which you&#39;re not. At least not yet -- as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I&#39;m not so sure about that.JOF (angry)
I didn&#39;t ask to have visions. I can&#39;t help it if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company.SKAT (sits up)
Haven&#39;t I told you once and for all that I need my morning&#39;s sleep! I have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I&#39;m telling you to shut up!His eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he left off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They sit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms vigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed and astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.MIA If we would only get some rain. Everything is burned to cinders. We won&#39;t have anything to eat this winter.JOF (yawning)
We&#39;ll get by.He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs contentedly.MIA I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.JOF Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.MIA What&#39;s that?JOF To make one of the balls stand absolutely still
in the air.MIA But that&#39;s impossible.JOF Impossible for us -- but not for him.MIA You&#39;re dreaming again.She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.
JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife&#39;s shoulders.JOF I&#39;ve composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn&#39;t sleep. Do you want to hear it?MIA Sing it. I&#39;m very curious.
JOF I have to sit up first.He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice.JOF (sings)
On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there&#39;s great joy on high.He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.JOF Mia! Are you asleep?MIA It&#39;s a lovely song.JOF I haven&#39;t finished yet.
MIA I heard it, but I think I&#39;ll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.JOF All you do is sleep.JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask.SKAT Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn&#39;t pay us so well, I&#39;d say no thank you.JOF Are you going to play Death?
SKAT Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense.JOF When are we supposed to do this play?SKAT At the saints&#39; feast in Elsinore. We&#39;re going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.
JOF Wouldn&#39;t it be better to play something bawdy? People like it better, and, besides, it&#39;s more fun.SKAT Idiot. There&#39;s a rumor going around that there&#39;s a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband.
JOF And what part am I to play?SKAT You&#39;re such a damn fool, so you&#39;re going to be the Soul of Man.JOF That&#39;s a bad part, of course.SKAT Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the
director of this company anyhow?SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.SKAT Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by a thread. Your time is short. (in his usual voice) Are the women going to like me in this getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already.He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. MIA lies beside him on the grass.MIA Jof!
JOF What is it?
MIA Sit still. Don&#39;t move.JOF What do you mean?MIA Don&#39;t say anything.JOF I&#39;m as silent as a grave.MIA Shh! I love you.Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces.JONS What is this supposed to represent?PAINTER The Dance of Death.JONS And that one is Death?
PAINTER Yes, he dances off with all of them.
JONS Why do you paint such nonsense?PAINTER I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die.
JONS Well, it&#39;s not going to make them feel any happier.PAINTER Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.JONS Then they&#39;ll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.
PAINTER Oh, they&#39;ll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman.
JONS If you do scare them ...PAINTER They&#39;ll think.JONS And if they think ...
PAINTER They&#39;ll become still more scared.
JONS And then they&#39;ll run right into the arms of the priests.PAINTER That&#39;s not my business.
JONS You&#39;re only painting your Dance of Death.PAINTER I&#39;m only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes.JONS Just think how some people will curse you.PAINTER Maybe. But then I&#39;ll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me.
JONS The plague. That sounds horrible.PAINTER You should see the boils on a diseased man&#39;s throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I&#39;ve painted over there.The PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain.JONS That looks terrible.PAINTER It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you?
JONS Scare? Me? You don&#39;t know me. What are the horrors you&#39;ve painted over there?PAINTER The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures
think the pestilence is the Lord&#39;s punishment. Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God.JONS Do they really whip themselves?PAINTER Yes, it&#39;s a terrible sight. I crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by.JONS Do you have any brandy? I&#39;ve been drinking water all day and it&#39;s made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.PAINTER I think I frightened you after all.JONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.The KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.
The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes. Christ&#39;s face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn&#39;t see him.KNIGHT I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.DEATH doesn&#39;t answer.
KNIGHT The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.DEATH doesn&#39;t answer.
KNIGHT Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.DEATH And yet you don&#39;t want to die.KNIGHT Yes, I do.
DEATH What are you waiting for?KNIGHT I want knowledge.DEATH You want guarantees?KNIGHT Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?DEATH doesn&#39;t answer.
KNIGHT How can we have faith in those who believe when we can&#39;t have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren&#39;t able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?The KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. There is complete silence.KNIGHT Why can&#39;t I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can&#39;t shake off? Do you hear me?DEATH Yes, I hear you.KNIGHT I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me.DEATH But He remains silent.
KNIGHT
I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there.
DEATH Perhaps no one is there.
KNIGHT Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.DEATH Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life.KNIGHT But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.DEATH When that day comes ...
KNIGHT In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.
DEATH You are worrying ...KNIGHT Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.DEATH What matter is that?
KNIGHT My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.DEATH Is that why you are playing chess with Death?KNIGHT He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven&#39;t lost a single man.DEATH How will you outwit Death in your game?KNIGHT I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn&#39;t yet discovered. In the next move I&#39;ll shatter one of his flanks.DEATH I&#39;ll remember that.DEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly.KNIGHT You&#39;ve tricked and cheated me! But we&#39;ll meet again, and I&#39;ll find a way.DEATH (invisible)
We&#39;ll meet at the inn, and there we&#39;ll continue playing.The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window.KNIGHT This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.Meanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly together.JONS Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?PAINTER The Crusade.JONS (drunk)
Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But what you said about the plague was horrible.PAINTER It&#39;s worse than that.JONS Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. That&#39;s the truth.PAINTER The rump behind you, the rump behind you there&#39;s a profound truth.JONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.JONS This is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn&#39;t appear to be fully conscious.JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman. JONS holds his nose.JONS That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What is it good for?SOLDIER She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil One.He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall.JONS And now she&#39;s in the stocks.SOLDIER She will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of us.JONS (holding his nose)
And you do that with this stinking mess?SOLDIER It&#39;s the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. The Devil can&#39;t stand the smell.JONS Neither can I.
JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes towards him.KNIGHT Have you seen the Devil?The MONK stops reading and raises his head.MONK You must not talk to her.KNIGHT Can that be so dangerous?MONK I don&#39;t know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected.KNIGHT I understand.He nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road.The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground.At the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag.Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the door. She stops and stares at the stranger.RAVEL Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead. These days it&#39;s quite a lucrative enterprise.The GIRL makes a movement as if to run away.RAVEL You&#39;re thinking of running to the village and telling. That wouldn&#39;t serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own skin. It&#39;s as simple as that.GIRL Don&#39;t touch me.RAVAL Don&#39;t try to scream. There&#39;s no one around to hear you, neither God nor man.Slowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.JONS I recognize you, although it&#39;s a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.RAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around.JONS Am I not right?The GIRL stands immobile.JONS You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better-
class crusade to the Holy Land.RAVAL looks around.
JONS You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
ache?RAVAL smiles anxiously.JONS When I see you, I suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.RAVEL I acted in good faith.JONS But now you know better, don&#39;t you? Because now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. Isn&#39;t that so?With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL&#39;S hand, gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly the GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.
JONS By all means. I&#39;m not bloodthirsty.He bends over RAVAL.RAVEL Don&#39;t beat me.JONS I don&#39;t have the heart to touch you, Doctor. But remember this: the next time we meet, I&#39;ll brand your face the way one does with thieves. (he rises)
What I really came for is to get my waterskin filled.GIRL We have a deep well with cool, fresh water. Come, I&#39;ll show you.They walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises slowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals away. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps him.JONS Jns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. I&#39;m kindest of all to young women. With them, there is no limit to my kindness.He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the GIRL on the cheek.JONS Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped you, but between you and me, I&#39;m tired of that kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.He laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance he turns; the GIRL is still there.JONS Now that I think of it, I will need a housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? (the GIRL nods)
As far as I know, I&#39;m still a married man, but
I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.
That&#39;s why I need a housekeeper. (the GIRL doesn&#39;t answer but gets up)
The devil with it! Come along and don&#39;t stand there staring. I&#39;ve saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.She begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn&#39;t wait for her but walks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are
merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.
The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps at JONS&#39;S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have finished SKAT comes forward and bows.SKAT Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your interest. Please remain standing for a
little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that&#39;s me.MIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. They bow, to the public.SKAT Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If you&#39;ll shut up over there, you&#39;ll see something splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I haven&#39;t entered yet. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. (he wipes the sweat from his forehead)
It&#39;s damned hot. I think we&#39;ll have a thunderstorm.He places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA&#39;s skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.SKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red.
He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself.
In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both height and volume.
SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn&#39;t quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.
The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.When he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn&#39;t neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes.Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.SKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman&#39;s rosy ear.His words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor&#39;s neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks.JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail ...VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
Does she snore?JOF May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn&#39;t snore.VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
I think she should snore anyhow.This opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and goes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail.
There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. Jealous I am, as never before, I hide myself behind this door. Faithful is she To her lover -- not me. He soon comes a-stealing To awaken her lusty feeling. I shall now kill him dead For cuckolding me in my bed. There he comes in the moonlight, His white legs shining bright. Quiet as a mouse, here I&#39;ll lie, Tell him not that he&#39;s about to die.JOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to the left.MIA Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my heart&#39;s delight.She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the heat.
Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall silent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.
JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression of horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to mutter half-forgotten prayers.All have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is heard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the hilltop.The cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.After the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, boys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling ecstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost rhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourging.Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed tightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, suffering scorn and shame.
The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-
brown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.MONK
God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall all perish in the black death. You, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour? Death stands right behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads. Which one of you shall he strike first? You there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, woman, who bloom with life and self-
satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns? You back
there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? Do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? You have been sentenced, sentenced!The MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful
glance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face
upwards.MONK
Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don&#39;t turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ.He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing and moaning.The procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the squire drinks his beer.JONS This damned ranting about doom. Is that food for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them seriously?The KNIGHT grins tiredly.JONS Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me to point out that I&#39;ve either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.KNIGHT (yawns) Yes, yes.
JONS Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --
all these I&#39;ve accepted without too much emotion.He leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.JONS (contentedly)
My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time&#39;s damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.The beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him like a shadow.In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He stops JONS with a roar.JONS What are you screaming about?PLOG I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire Jns.JONS That&#39;s possible.PLOG Have you seen my wife?
JONS No, I haven&#39;t. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I&#39;d quickly forget that I&#39;d seen her.PLOG
Well, in that case you haven&#39;t seen her.JONS Maybe she&#39;s run off.PLOG Do you know anything?
JONS I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.The smith sighs sadly and goes inside.The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns
on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays
piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and
perspiration.
MERCHANT
Yes, it&#39;s true! The plague is spreading along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I&#39;ve still got my whole stock unsold.WOMAN They speak of the judgment day. And all these omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf&#39;s head.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Imagine.FARMER
It hasn&#39;t rained here for a month. We&#39;ll surely lose our crops.MERCHANT
And people are acting crazy, I&#39;d say. They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Just think, just think!FARMER If it&#39;s as they say, I suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.WOMAN But there have been other things too, such things that can&#39;t even be spoken of. (whispers)
Things that mustn&#39;t be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that&#39;s why she must cleanse herself.OLD MAN Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they&#39;ll come on judgment night, at sundown.WOMAN There are many who have purged themselves with
fire and died from it, but the priests say that it&#39;s better to die pure than to live for hell.
MERCHANT This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out
loud, but all of us know that it&#39;s the end. And people are going mad from fear.FARMER
So you&#39;re afraid too.MERCHANT
Of course I&#39;m afraid.OLD MAN The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.PLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table.RAVAL Do you want this armlet? You can have it cheap.JOF I can&#39;t afford it.RAVAL It&#39;s real silver.JOF It&#39;s nice. But it&#39;s surely too expensive for me.PLOG Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?JOF Has she disappeared?PLOG They say she&#39;s run away.JOF Has she deserted you?PLOG With an actor.JOF An actor! If she&#39;s got such bad taste, then I think you should let her go.PLOG You&#39;re right. My first thought, of course, was to kill her.JOF Oh. But to murder her, that&#39;s a terrible thing to do.PLOG I&#39;m also going to kill the actor.JOF The actor?PLOG Of course, the one she eloped with.JOF What has he done to deserve that?PLOG Are you stupid?
JOF The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn&#39;t done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he&#39;s an actor.PLOG You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre.JOF And that turned out to be her misfortune.PLOG Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who&#39;s born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn&#39;t that true?Now RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil.
RAVAL Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith.JOF I! A liar!
RAVAL You&#39;re an actor too and it&#39;s probably your partner who&#39;s run off with Plog&#39;s old lady.PLOG Are you an actor too?JOF An actor! Me! I wouldn&#39;t quite call myself that!RAVAL We ought to kill you; it&#39;s only logical.JOF (laughs)
You&#39;re really funny.RAVAL How strange -- you&#39;ve turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience?JOF You&#39;re funny. Don&#39;t you think he&#39;s funny? (to Plog)
Oh, you don&#39;t.RAVAL Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.PLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.
PLOG (shouting)
What have you done with my wife?The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.JOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him.
JOF Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked someone, or got in the way? I&#39;ll leave right now and never come back.JOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense.
RAVAL Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder.Trembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out.
RAVAL Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are.JOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so
that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand.PLOG (shouts) What have you done with my wife?PLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over
him.
RAVAL Don&#39;t lie there moaning. Get up and dance.JOF I don&#39;t want to. I can&#39;t.RAVEL Show us how you imitate a bear.JOF I can&#39;t play a bear.RAVAL Let&#39;s see if you can&#39;t after all.RAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him.RAVEL Up again! Be a good bear.JOF I haven&#39;t done any harm. I haven&#39;t got the strength to play a bear any more.At that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals
out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at each other.JONS Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again?RAVAL steps back without speaking.JONS I&#39;m a man who keeps his word.JONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers towards the wall.The hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and
the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.
The players&#39; wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. They play together and laugh happily.Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea.Not far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He lifts his head.The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. The KNIGHT gets up.MIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the KNIGHT.KNIGHT What&#39;s his name?MIA Mikael.KNIGHT How old is he?MIA Oh, he&#39;ll soon be two.KNIGHT He&#39;s big for his age.MIA Do you think so? Yes, I guess he&#39;s rather big.She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.KNIGHT You played some kind of show this afternoon.MIA Did you think it was bad?KNIGHT You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.MIA You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we&#39;re in real trouble now.KNIGHT Is that your husband?MIA (laughs)
Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof.
KNIGHT Oh, that one.MIA And now there&#39;s only him and me. We&#39;ll have to start doing tricks again and that&#39;s more trouble than it&#39;s worth.KNIGHT Do you do tricks also?MIA We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful juggler.KNIGHT Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?MIA Jof wants him to be.KNIGHT But you don&#39;t.MIA I don&#39;t know.
(smiling)
Perhaps he&#39;ll become a knight.KNIGHT Let me assure you, that&#39;s no pleasure either.MIA No, you don&#39;t look so happy.KNIGHT No.MIA Are you tired?KNIGHT Yes.MIA Why?
KNIGHT I have dull company.MIA Do you mean your squire?KNIGHT No, not him.MIA Who do you mean, then?KNIGHT Myself.MIA I understand.KNIGHT Do you, really?
MIA Yes, I understand rather well. I have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn&#39;t that so?She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?
What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband&#39;s
dirty, bloody face.
Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems unhurt.JOF Ouch, it hurts.MIA
Why did you have to go there? And of course you drank.MIA&#39;s anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder than necessary.JOF Ouch! I didn&#39;t drink anything.MIA
Then I suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. People don&#39;t like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies.JOF I swear to you that I didn&#39;t say a word about angels.MIA
You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and you know it.JOF doesn&#39;t answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of MIA with an injured expression.JOF Look what I bought for you.MIA You couldn&#39;t afford it.JOF (angry)
But I got it anyhow.The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each other, touch each other&#39;s hands. JOF puts his head against MIA&#39;S shoulder and sighs.JOF Oh, how they beat me.MIA Why didn&#39;t you beat them back?JOF I only become frightened and angry. I never get a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a lion.MIA
Were they frightened?JOF No, they just laughed.Their son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at MIKAEL.MIA Do you notice how good he smells?JOF And he is so compact to hold. You&#39;re a sturdy one. A real acrobat&#39;s body.He lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, remembering the knight&#39;s presence.MIA Yes, this is my husband, Jof.JOF Good evening.KNIGHT Good evening.
JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one another silently.
KNIGHT I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He&#39;ll bring great joy to you.JOF Yes, he&#39;s fine.
They become silent again.
JOF Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?KNIGHT Thank you, I don&#39;t want anything.MIA (housewifely)
I picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow ...JOF ... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor.MIA Please be seated and I&#39;ll bring the food.They sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL.KNIGHT Where are you going next?JOF Up to the saints&#39; feast at Elsinore.KNIGHT I wouldn&#39;t advise you to go there.JOF Why not, if I may ask?KNIGHT The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It&#39;s said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.JOF Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard.KNIGHT May I suggest ... (JOF looks at him, surprised)
... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You&#39;ll probably be safer there.MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon.JOF I wish you good appetite.KNIGHT I humbly thank you.MIA These are wild strawberries from the forest. I have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!She points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought. JOF eats heartily.JOF Your suggestion is good, but I must think it over.MIA It might be wise to have company going through the forest. It&#39;s said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.JOF (staunchly)
Yes, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s not a bad idea, but I have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company.MIA (mimics) After all, I have become director of the whole company.JONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA points with her spoon.MIA Do you want some strawberries?JOF This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, and let us be together.MIA (stretches herself) Oh, how nice this is.KNIGHT For a short while.
MIA Nearly always. One day is like another. There is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don&#39;t have to be cold. But spring is best of all.JOF I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps you&#39;d like to hear it. I&#39;ll run and get my lyre.He sprints towards the wagon.
MIA Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by your songs.JONS (politely) By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you&#39;ve heard yet.The KNIGHT looks at him.JONS You&#39;ll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don&#39;t appreciate my art and I don&#39;t want to upset anyone. I&#39;m a sensitive soul.JOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies down.KNIGHT People are troubled by so much.MIA It&#39;s always better when one is two. Have you no one of your own?KNIGHT Yes, I think I had someone.MIA And what is she doing now?KNIGHT I don&#39;t know.MIA You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?KNIGHT We were newly married and we played together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at night we danced. The house was full of life ...MIA Do you want some more strawberries?KNIGHT (shakes his head)
Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.MIA I don&#39;t understand what you mean.KNIGHT Everything I&#39;ve said seems meaningless and unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it all becomes suddenly.He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.MIA Now you don&#39;t look so solemn.KNIGHT I shall remember this moment. The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,
your faces in the evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I&#39;ll try to remember what we have talked about. I&#39;ll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky.KNIGHT And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues to play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.The KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is quiet and deserted; the sea is still.DEATH I have been waiting for you.KNIGHT Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. Because I revealed my tactics to you, I&#39;m in retreat. It&#39;s your move.DEATH Why do you look so satisfied?KNIGHT That&#39;s my secret.
DEATH Of course. Now I take your knight.KNIGHT You did the right thing.DEATH Have you tricked me?
KNIGHT Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!DEATH What are you laughing at?KNIGHT Don&#39;t worry about my laughter; save your king instead.DEATH You&#39;re rather arrogant.KNIGHT Our game amuses me.DEATH It&#39;s your move. Hurry up. I&#39;m a little pressed for time.KNIGHT I understand that you&#39;ve a lot to do, but you can&#39;t get out of our game. It takes time.DEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT smiles.DEATH Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son?KNIGHT Why do you ask?DEATH Oh, no reason at all.
The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.
There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing.JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers.JONS God in heaven, isn&#39;t this Plog, the smith?PLOG Good evening.JONS Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?PLOG Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a rabbit.JONS If I were in your boots, I&#39;d be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side.PLOG Are you married?
JONS I! A hundred times and more. I can&#39;t keep count of all my wives any longer. But it&#39;s often that way when you&#39;re a traveling man.PLOG I can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else I&#39;ve had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn&#39;t impossible.JONS Yes, it&#39;s hell with women and hell without them. So, however you look at it, it&#39;s still best to kill them off while it&#39;s most amusing.
PLOG Women&#39;s nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil&#39;s aunt for a mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there&#39;s a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead.JONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman&#39;s voice.JONS Why don&#39;t you kiss me good night?PLOG (in the same way)
Why don&#39;t you sing a song for me?JONS Why don&#39;t you love me the way you did when we first met?PLOG Why don&#39;t you look at my new slip?JONS You only turn your back and snore.PLOG Oh hell!
JONS Oh hell. And now she&#39;s gone. Rejoice!
PLOG (furious) I&#39;ll snip their noses with pliers, I&#39;ll bash in their chests with a small hammer, I&#39;ll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.PLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.JONS
Look how he howls again.PLOG Maybe I love her.JONS So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor misguided ham shank, I&#39;ll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.PLOG
Yes, but it hurts anyway.JONS Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. But you almost always get over it.PLOG
No, no, not me.JONS Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.PLOG You&#39;re happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel.JONS Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you&#39;ll get two pieces for the price of one,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |8.2   |1958-10-13  |tt0050976|

I was his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone... inspires us the way he did. I believed in Harvey Dent...&#34;Eight years later, a van is driving across a field, occupied by Russian soldiers. They are transporting a nuclear scientist, Dr. Leonid Pavel (Alon Aboutboul). Sitting in the backseats are three prisoners, who are handcuffed, have hoods over their heads, and rifles trained on them. The van arrives at an airfield, where it meets a jet occupied by a CIA agent, Bill Wilson, (Aidan Gillen) and U.S. Special Ops soldiers from an extraction team, whom Dr. Pavel has cut a deal with. The CIA agent refuses to let the hooded prisoners come on his aircraft. The agent is told by the truck driver, Barsad (Josh Stewart), that they are mercenaries who work for the masked man. He takes it that the &#34;masked man&#34; is Bane, an infamous terrorist, and brings them on board.During the flight, Wilson interrogates the prisoners for information about Bane. He has one prisoner dragged to the cargo door and demands to know who paid the men to kidnap Dr. Pavel. When the man refuses to talk, Wilson pulls his pistol and fires a shot away from the man&#39;s head and pulls the man back inside. The second prisoner is pulled over to the door and given the same treatment. This time, Wilson asks him about the mask that Bane wears. The man fails to talk leading Wilson to believe he&#39;s &#34;awfully loyal for a hired gun&#34;.At this point, the third prisoner - who sounds like he is talking through a voice amplifier- suggests that his comrade is wondering why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane? Wilson signals for one soldier to seal the door and asks this prisoner for his name. The hooded man says that it doesn&#39;t matter who he and his comrades are, but it&#39;s their plan that matters. As the man admits that &#34;no one cared who I was &#39;til I put on the mask&#34;, Wilson removes his hood, revealing a bald, muscular brute wearing an intimidating breathing apparatus over his mouth - Bane (Tom Hardy).Wilson asks Bane if he will die if he takes off the mask, and Bane assures him it would be extremely painful...for Wilson. Wilson congratulates Bane for getting himself caught, and asks him what the next step of his master plan is. Bane boldly announces it: crashing the very plane they are on right now.... with no survivors!On cue, a team of henchmen fast-rope out of a C-130 Hercules that has descended over the jet, land on the small plane&#39;s wings, and shoot out the side windows with guns, while Bane breaks his handcuffs and punches Wilson. The henchmen attach cables to the plane with hooks behind the wings, and plant bombs in the fuselage. As the plane begins to nosedive, the stress tears the wings off. Two henchmen then climb up and set off charges to blow off the tail section. One soldier draws his pistol and manages to get off one round before he is shot dead by a mercenary descending into the plane. The mercenaries also lower in a body bag containing the corpse of a man who looks like Dr. Pavel.Bane grabs Dr. Pavel, and pulls out a small tube with needles on both ends. He inserts one end into Dr. Pavel&#39;s arm and the other into the corpse, and starts to perform a blood transfer. Bane spots one of his comrades escaping and orders the man to stop, as the authorities expect to find one of them in the wreckage. The man asks Bane if they&#39;ve started a fire, and Bane says, &#34;Yes, the fire rises.&#34; Bane attaches the harness to himself and Dr. Pavel, and tells the doctor that the time to panic will come later. He sets off a detonator, which releases the fuselage to plummet to Earth. Bane and Dr. Pavel are then reeled up into the bigger plane.In Gotham, the eighth anniversary of Harvey Dent&#39;s death is being celebrated as Dent Day. At a Wayne Manor charity event hosted by the forever-absent Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), Gordon prepares to deliver a speech revealing the truth about Dent and the murders for which the Batman had taken the fall 8 years ago followed by his own resignation as commissioner, but deciding that the time is not right, and having flashbacks of Dent holding his son hostage, he stuffs the speech into his jacket. His Deputy Commissioner Peter Foley (Matthew Modine) talks with the city&#39;s congressman Byron Gilly (Brett Cullen), who informs him that with the drop in crime, Gordon is a war hero in peacetime, and the mayor plans on dumping him in the spring. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a wealthy investor, and businessman John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) try to meet the reclusive Bruce to get him to invest in her clean energy project, but are unable to meet him. Daggett is curious why Miranda is interested in seeing a guy who threw away her investment, but Miranda chides him for only understanding money and the power he thinks it buys.One of the maids for the event is Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a young cat burglar, who breaks into Bruce&#39;s room on the pretense of delivering dinner. She cracks his safe, stealing his mother&#39;s pearl necklace, which has a tracking device built into it. She starts looking around the place, observing a photo of Bruce&#39;s parents. As she notices a target with several arrows embedded in it, Bruce comes in, hobbling on a cane, and announces himself by shooting another arrow into the bullseye, causing Selina to jump. She tries to apologize, and comments that Bruce doesn&#39;t look anything like the rumors make him out to be. Bruce immediately notices the necklace and outs her as a thief. Caught, Selina&#39;s tone and attitude change. She points out that Bruce wouldn&#39;t beat up a woman so much as she would beat up a cripple.... &#34;of course exceptions have to be made.&#34; She kicks his cane out from under him, spilling him to the floor, then escapes by doing a backflip out of a window. She changes out of her disguise as she makes her way to the Congressman&#39;s car and asks for a ride.Alfred (Michael Caine) comes up to Bruce&#39;s room and finds Bruce looking at the breached safe. Learning that the intruder was one of the maids, he dryly suggests that Bruce stop letting maids into this part of the house. Bruce has found print dust and realizes that Selina also took a copy of his fingerprints.Later that night, Gordon looks through some files on the police station&#39;s roof, next to the destroyed Batsignal, when he is approached by rookie police officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who informs him about the Congressman&#39;s disappearance. Blake reveals that he has suspicions about Dent&#39;s death and the last confirmed Batman sighting, but Gordon dismisses him, takes one look at the Batsignal, and departs.The next morning, Alfred finds Bruce working on the computers in the Batcave. The prints their jewel thief was using were not her own, but rather those of a male armed-robbery suspect. Bruce notes that by using the pearls&#39; tracking device, he was able to get their thief&#39;s address and cross-reference it with police information to produce Selina&#39;s name. Selina is a master jewel thief nicknamed as &#34;the Cat&#34;. She&#39;s been arrested a few times for various crimes like assault, resisting arrest, even breaking out of a women&#39;s correctional facility when she just sixteen years old. Alfred suggests that Bruce go out with Selina, and move on from the grief he&#39;s had over Rachel&#39;s death eight years ago.Alfred surprises Bruce when informing him that during the seven years before Bruce returned to Gotham to become Batman, Alfred hoped that Bruce would never return. He tells Bruce that he wished that while in a cafe during his yearly vacation Florence, Italy after Bruce had disappeared, he would see Bruce happily with a woman, married, having a normal life. They would silently acknowledge each other.Blake and his partner Officer Tyler Ross (Reggie Lee) show up at a sewage treatment plant, where a dead body has washed up out of one of the tunnels. Blake recognizes the body as that of a kid staying at St. Swithin&#39;s orphanage. Blake has a very close relationship with the orphanage and with Father Reilly (Chris Ellis), the warden, and we realize that he grew up in that orphanage, which had been funded by the Wayne Foundation until recently. One of the kids at the orphanage informs him that the sewers provide good employment, which makes Blake suspicious.A few nights later, Selina Kyle walks into a bar with a drunk man. She seats him at the counter, then walks over to another table and meets with Philip Stryver (Burn Gorman), Daggett&#39;s assistant CEO. She hands him a slide that contains four of Bruce&#39;s right hand fingerprints. When Selina asks if Stryver has something in return for her, he signals for one of his men to lock the door. Selina smiles, and admits that although she doesn&#39;t want to know what Stryver is planning to use Bruce&#39;s prints for, she knows he&#39;ll need a thumbprint as well. Stryver has another hoodlum put a pistol to Selina&#39;s head to threaten her. She hesitates for a moment, but hands her cell phone to Stryver and tells him to hit the send button.There is a knock at the door, and Selina&#39;s friend, a young woman named Jen (Juno Temple), comes in. She enters and notices that the place seems a little quiet, but Selina assures her that the place will liven up in a few minutes, and Jen leaves.Selina then hands Stryver another envelope containing the thumbprint slide. He draws his pistol, prepared to shoot her, and informs Selina that, even in the black dress she&#39;s decided to wear tonight, she will not be missed by anyone. Unfortunately for Stryver, Selina reveals that she has anticipated this, for she says that while that might be true about her, the cops are missing her friend, the drunk, who is, in fact, the missing congressman, and Stryver has just accidentally used the congressman&#39;s cell phone to send a message to the police.Suddenly, the room is filled with the sound of police cars screeching to a halt outside. Immediately, the thugs draw their pistols and Selina attacks them, disarming one thug. Outside, a SWAT team advances up to the front doors with submachine guns drawn. Selina wrestles with Stryver and drags him over the table, knocking him out, while other henchmen escape out through the kitchen. Just then, the SWAT officers begin swinging a battering ram at the locked front doors. With seconds to act, Selina grabs Stryver&#39;s pistol, inserts a fresh magazine, and shoots one henchman, killing him instantly. Selina pistol-punches Stryver, then shoots another thug as he tries to draw his weapon.The SWAT team breaches the doors, shooting a third henchman as they enter. Selina promptly screams hysterically, pretending to be a frightened hostage. The SWAT officers chase the thugs into the kitchen and out the back door, where the hoodlums open fire on them and a shootout ensues. Amidst the echoes of gunfire, Selina walks over to the congressman, who has taken a bullet in the leg, tells him to apply pressure to his wound, then saunters out the front door, where she immediately runs into Blake, to whom she passes herself off as a bystander.While Selina escapes, Blake makes his way through the bar with his pistol. He heads out back to the alleyway to provide support to the SWAT officers, who have been pinned down behind a parked truck. As they break cover and prepare to fire their guns at the henchmen, Barsad, stationed on a fire escape, shoots three of them in the back with a sniper rifle. The remaining henchmen sprint for safety, and as they disappear around another corner, Gordon and Foley arrive with backup. They enter the alley the henchmen fled into, but find that the men have vanished. While a few officers head up a stairwell to look for the henchmen there, Gordon spots a displaced manhole and takes three SWAT officers with him to search the tunnel.The four men climb down the ladder into the sewers in pursuit. As they are searching the tunnel, thugs ambush and open fire on them. A bomb goes off, taking out Gordon&#39;s backup and shooting a fireball out of the open manhole. Foley mistakes the blast for a gas explosion, but Blake realizes where Gordon might turn up and quickly runs to his car.As Gordon starts further into the tunnel with his flashlight and pistol drawn, and no backup to help him, two of Bane&#39;s men corner him from behind and knock him out. They grab him by his arms, and drag him, still semi-conscious, through a labyrinth of tunnels. As Gordon is dragged deeper in, he notices men with assault rifles and submachine guns overseeing teams of hoodlums doing construction on the walls. The two henchmen bring Gordon to an cavern with a waterfall, where they deposit him in front of a shirtless Bane.Bane asks the two henchmen why they thought to bring Gordon down here. When the first one says he and his comrade didn&#39;t know what to do, Bane tells them that they&#39;ve failed in their duties, and their weakness has cost the lives of three people. He immediately the first guy&#39;s neck, then tells the other he will kill him after he searches Gordon&#39;s jacket. The second thug empties Gordon&#39;s pockets, taking Gordon&#39;s badge, wallet, pistol, and Gordon&#39;s speech about Harvey Dent. Bane looks over Gordon&#39;s speech, deciding that it is useful to his plans.Gordon sees that his captors are occupied, and when Bane has his back turned, he rolls off the platform into a waterway. Bane&#39;s men open fire on Gordon as he floats away, hitting him several times. Barsad hands Bane a tracking device, which he places on the second thug. He then shoots him dead with Gordon&#39;s pistol and throws his body into the waterway.Outside the tunnels, Blake jumps out of his car near the sewer outlet, and rushes to the exit grate, where he finds Gordon, soaked and barely clinging onto life.After rushing Gordon to the hospital, Blake goes to Wayne Manor to inform Bruce of the shooting, the reason being that he&#39;s figured out himself that Bruce is Batman. He explains to Bruce that when he was five years old, his mother died in a car accident, and a few years later, his father was shot dead in a gambling dispute. He&#39;s figured out Bruce&#39;s identity from the fact that while growing up as an orphan, Blake learned to smile in the mirror to hide his anger. None of Gordon&#39;s own cops, not even Foley, believe Gordon&#39;s babbling about an underground army, and Blake makes a plea for Bruce to return as Batman to stop Bane.As Bruce watches Blake drive off, he asks Alfred about Bane. Alfred mentions that Bane is a mercenary and it is known that he and his men carried out a coup in a West African country that secured diamond mining operations for Daggett. Bruce asks Alfred why his foundation stopped funding Blake&#39;s orphanage, and Alfred reveals that the Wayne Foundation is funded by Wayne Enterprises profits. Figuring it&#39;s time to talk to Fox, Bruce asks Alfred for a car and for an appointment at Gordon&#39;s hospital for an examination on his leg. He is then seen pulling out of the driveway in his Lamborghini.The orthopedist at the hospital tells Bruce that the cartilage in his left knee is gone and combined with the other damage to his body, he cannot recommend that Bruce go heliskiing. As soon as the doctor leaves the room, Bruce dons a ski mask and fast-ropes down to Gordon&#39;s hospital room. He finds Gordon hooked up to multiple machines. Though barely able to talk, Gordon insists that Batman must return to stop Bane.Bruce next tracks down Selina Kyle to her apartment in a rundown neighborhood, using the tracking device planted in his mother&#39;s necklace. Inside, Selina has put on the necklace and is preparing to go out for a night on the town when she hears a commotion in the hallway. Jen is being threatened by a yuppie she has pickpocketed. Selina defuses the situation by twisting the guy&#39;s hand and forcing him against the wall, in the process stealing his watch. Bruce then watches as she emerges and climbs into a cab, and follows her.Bruce ends up tailing Selina to a gala costume ball. As he leaves his car with the valet, the paparazzi recognize him and start to snap photos of him, but Bruce uses a remote in his pocket that shuts down everyone&#39;s cameras, then is waved through by the greeter. Inside, Bruce watches Selina as she is dancing with an older man. She is wearing a domino mask and a headband with a set of cat ears. As he watches her, he is approached by Miranda Tate, the party organizer. She is astonished to see him, since Bruce rarely ever came to charity events even before he retired from his role as Batman. They make some small-talk about the Wayne Enterprises energy project, and then Miranda departs, leaving Bruce free to track down Selina.Bruce cuts in with Selina&#39;s dancing partner as the next routine begins. She is annoyed that he came. As they slowly waltz, Selina reveals her desire to get a fresh start, and claims she wants to see the rich lose and the city burn. Bruce tells her that all of her assumptions of him are wrong. Selina tells him that there&#39;s a storm coming, having some knowledge of Bane&#39;s plans, and that she&#39;s adaptable. Although he admits that his mother&#39;s necklace looks better on Selina than locked in a safe, he doesn&#39;t believe she deserves it, and he removes them from her neck. Selina responds to this by suddenly planting a passionate kiss on him, in the process pickpocketing his valet ticket, and then leaves. Bruce then finds out the hard way that she has stolen his car by pretending to be his wife.Bruce goes to his company offices the next day to meet with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who assures him that his majority ownership of Wayne Enterprises keeps Daggett from taking over the company despite him blowing the R&amp;D department&#39;s budget on the mothballed nuclear project. He takes Bruce down to the R&amp;D department and shows him a new toy - a sleek flying aircraft. It is a U.S. army project designed for urban combat, with rotors that make it capable of navigating between buildings without recirculation. The project, which has a long project designation, is one that Fox simply nicknames &#34;the Bat&#34;, and that yes, it does come in black. The Bat currently works fine, although Fox warns that the broken autopilot could be repaired with someone of Bruce&#39;s intellect.To get back into physical shape, Bruce straps on motorized leg braces and does basic martial arts in the Batcave. Alfred walks in while Bruce is practicing a roundhouse kick, and tells Bruce that he needs to know about rumors that surround Bane. Supposedly, Bane escaped from a middle-eastern prison known for brutality and simply called the &#34;Pits of Hell.&#34; Bane then became a member of the League of Shadows, and was trained by Ra&#39;s al-Ghul. Bane was excommunicated from the group for extreme behavior beyond the boundaries of the League. Alfred warns Bruce that anyone too extreme for the likes of Ra&#39;s al-Ghul is not to be trifled with. He believes Bruce has a death wish to go back to being Batman.That evening, Bane and three of his men carry out an assault and robbery on the Gotham Stock Exchange. One henchman, McGarrity, (David Dayan Fisher) enters the building by posing as a shoeshiner, working at a stand by an entrance to the trading floor, stashing a submachine gun in his gym bag. A second unnamed henchman (Massi Furlan) enters disguised as a janitor, and pretends to mop the floor in the front stairwell, hiding a submachine gun in his water bucket. A third henchman, Petrov, sneaks onto the trading floor by posing as a sandwich delivery man.Prior to closing time, McGarrity and the janitor drop what they are doing, wait until there is no one around to see them, then draw their weapons and make their way to the trading floor. At the same time, Bane arrives at the rear entrance disguised as a deliveryman, and wearing a motorcycle helmet to hide his face. When he walks through the metal detector, an alarm goes off. A female security guard stops Bane and orders him to take off his helmet so their cameras can see his face. He removes his helmet, revealing his gas mask. Before the guards can react, Bane lashes out with lethal blows, punching the female guard with his helmet. He knocks out a second guard. A third guard tries to draw his gun, but Bane twists his gun hand, punches him in the crotch with his other hand, shoots a fourth guard, and lastly fracture&#39;s the third guard&#39;s skull.Upstairs, as McGarrity and the janitor walk into the trading floor, Petrov suddenly draws a pistol from a paper bag, whips his customer over the shoulder with the barrel, and shoots a nearby trader. McGarrity and the janitor raise their submachine guns and open fire, sending traders diving for cover. The three henchmen cease shooting as Bane strides onto the floor. He looks around, and notices a trader who we just saw getting his shoes shined by McGarrity moments earlier. As the trader protests that there is no money for Bane to steal, Bane drags the man by his necktie over to another terminal, and slams his head against the table, knocking him out. McGarrity pulls a laptop out of his bag and uses a USB cable to hook it into the computer terminal. Bane uses the trader&#39;s security card to log in to the system, and a series of trades begin running across the screen.The police, including Foley and several SWAT teams, arrive outside the exchange in full force. The security chief at the exchange is worried as Bane has access to everyone&#39;s financial assets. Foley refuses to risk endangering hostages. He orders the fiber line and cell tower shut down in an attempt to stall Bane. Inside, Bane is not alarmed when McGarrity reports this to him.While Foley is dealing with the stock exchange&#39;s security chief, Blake arrives, climbs out of his car, and notices a cement mixer truck parked on the nearby corner, obstructing the street. He walks over and tells the driver to move his truck. There is a short argument as the driver insists he has nowhere to move. Blake tells him to back his truck up. Suddenly, an alarm goes off, and a barrier ramp is raised at the end of the block to keep the robbers from leaving the street. Blake orders the driver to stay in his truck and rushes off.Inside the exchange, Bane asks McGarrity for a progress report. McGarrity reports that they need eight more minutes to complete the program. Bane looks at the clock and says that they are leaving. The janitor orders everyone to stand, raises his submachine gun and fires into the ceiling, sending hostages scrambling to their feet. McGarrity stuffs his tablet into his bag, while Bane grabs his helmet and starts for the exit.The officers aim their pistols and rifles at the front doors as the hostages begin to exit the building with their hands raised over their heads. A sniper stationed on a rooftop across the street notices a couple of bright headlights inside the lobby. Before he can register what they are, the crowd dives for cover as Bane bursts out of the building riding a motorcycle, followed by McGarrity, Petrov, and the janitor. Each robber is carrying a hostage, strapped to the back of his motorcycle. Foley yells for the officers to hold their fire. Bane and his men weave through the police cars, speed past Blake and the cement truck, use the crash barriers as ramps to jump over a few police cars, and escape. As they pass the cement truck and Blake&#39;s position, Bane and the janitor throw their hostages off. Foley shouts orders, and officers jump into the cars and speed away, tires screeching, as they give chase.Bane and his men race through the streets. As they enter a tunnel, a single police car, driven by rookie officer Simon Jansen (Will Estes) and his veteran partner Kelly (Brent Briscoe) catches on to them. Jansen tells Kelly, riding shotgun, to shoot the tires, but Kelly doesn&#39;t have a clean shot. Foley orders them over the radio to drop back to avoid endangering the hostages.Suddenly, Jansen notices the tunnel lights behind them going out by themselves. The tunnel goes dark, and the police car&#39;s engine and battery suddenly cut off for a few seconds. Something sleek and black races past their car and Kelly tells his partner, &#34;Oh boy! You are in for a show tonight, son.&#34; Seconds later, Petrov&#39;s motorcycle suddenly sputters out. As Petrov comes to a stop, his hostage makes a break for it. Petrov aims his pistol, preparing to shoot the hostage, when Batman slams into him, knocking off his bike. He then climbs back on the Batpod, aims an EMP gun, and shorts out the janitor&#39;s motorcycle, bringing him to a stop. Just then, Officer Jansen shoots Batman&#39;s weapon. Jansen apologizes before his partner orders him back in the car.Receiving word of the Batman&#39;s return, Foley jumps into Blake&#39;s cruiser, and they drive off to join the chase. As they drive, Foley orders every unit brought in, eager to take down Batman, even though Blake believes they should be focusing on stopping Bane from escaping.While the car chase unfolds, Selina breaks into Daggett&#39;s safe looking for the Clean Slate software program, which has the potential to expunge her criminal record. She is using special safecracking goggles that flip up and look like cat ears when she is not using them. When she opens the safe, she is enraged to find that it is empty.As Batman chases Bane and McGarrity on the Batpod, Bane notices that the laptop application is 91% complete. With the cops closing in, Bane signals to McGarrity, then makes a tight u-turn. A pursuing officer reports this to Foley over the radio, but Foley orders the officers to let Bane go and instead stay on Batman&#39;s trail. As a result, Bane is able to race through the police cars without any of them trying to intercept him, doing a second glance over his shoulder as he passes Batman. Once at a safe spot, he watches the chase for a few moments to make sure no one has seen him, then rides into a storm drain to head back to his hideout.Batman rescues McGarrity&#39;s hostage and uses his bike to block the mercenary near a highway on-ramp. Batman steps up to McGarrity, shatters his visor with his fist, and looks at the laptop, which now reads &#34;application complete.&#34; As the police surround him, Batman grabs the laptop hard drive, then sets off an explosion with the Batpod cannons and jumps off of a stopped auto carrier. After another harrowing chase, the police box him in, and Batman turns into an alleyway. It appears that Batman has been cornered &#34;like a rat in a trap,&#34; but as Foley prepares to speak into a megaphone, a blue light and odd humming noise appears at the end of the alleyway, and Kelly tells Foley he&#39;s got the wrong animal. The Bat emerges, and flies out and over the police officers, its downdraft pinning the cops down. Blake casually asks Foley if he&#39;s sure that was Batman who just flew off. Furious, Foley shoves the megaphone into Blake&#39;s hand.At Daggett&#39;s penthouse, Stryver reports to Daggett that the robbery was successful even with Batman&#39;s interference, and Bane has assured him the men who were captured will die before talking. Daggett tells a servant to open champagne and heads to his office. As he enters the office, he asks &#34;Can we get some girls in here?&#34; A voice promptly says, &#34;Careful what you wish for,&#34; at which point Selina suddenly appears, attacks Daggett from behind, throws him across the room and pins him to the wall with her left boot restraining his right arm and her hand grasping his neck. She demands to know where the Clean Slate program is. Stryver comes in and puts a pistol to the back of Selina&#39;s head, but she disarms him by stomping her serrated heel on his instep. One of Daggett&#39;s bodyguards bursts in. Selina holds him off by aiming her pistol at the bodyguard while collaring Daggett. She shoots out the window, and jumps onto a window-washing platform with Daggett, which she lowers to the ground.On the nearby rooftop, Selina pins Daggett down, and jams Stryver&#39;s pistol into his neck, trying to get him to talk. Daggett admits that he lied about the Clean Slate, which he considered a &#34;gangland myth&#34;. As Selina tries to control herself and takes this in, Bane&#39;s men surround her. She grabs Daggett and tries using him as a human shield to warn the henchmen to back off, but they ignore her. Batman appears, and he and Selina attack the mercenaries, disarming several of them. Selina is annoyed when Batman disarms her of her pistol when she&#39;s about to shoot a henchman. Suddenly, Barsad and some other mercenaries appear and open fire on them, forcing Batman and Selina to run towards the edge of the roof. Batman jumps off the roof and into the Bat, parked below the roof ledge. Selina hesitates for a moment, but makes the jump when she sees Bane approaching her. Bane can only watch as the Bat flies away.Batman deposits Selina on a rooftop. She is annoyed that he tried to interfere, not even so much as giving a &#34;thank you&#34; to him. Bruce manages to figure out what she did with his fingerprints and learns that Daggett was interested in the exchange robbery. However, before Bruce can find out more, he is forced to duck as the spotlight of a police helicopter flying by shines over the roof. When he looks back up, Selina has vanished. &#34;So that&#39;s what it feels like,&#34; he says to himself.Returning to the Batcave, Bruce asks Alfred to have Fox decode the hard drive and also notices his thumbprint scan is on the application. His decision to return as Batman leads to a spat with Alfred, who is afraid he has a death wish. Alfred leaves Bruce and the mansion for good after revealing the contents of Rachel&#39;s farewell letter to Bruce, given to Alfred prior to her death at the Joker&#39;s hands in The Dark Knight. Alfred had burned the letter to protect Bruce from pain, since before her death Rachel chose Harvey Dent over Bruce as her lover.The next morning, Bruce learns from Fox that in the course of the robbery, Bane made stock trades to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises, meaning Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into Daggett&#39;s hands. To protect one secret, Bruce and Fox show Miranda the fusion reactor. Fox and Miranda intend to use it for generating clean energy for the entire city, although Bruce is afraid of the chance that someone will turn the reactor into a nuclear weapon, as Dr. Pavel managed to discover. None of them are aware that Bane has in fact kidnapped Dr. Pavel for this purpose. The reactor is hidden in a chamber underneath the river so that it can be flooded for containment in emergencies. Bruce wants Miranda to become acting CEO of Wayne Enterprises to safeguard the reactor.Bruce is later booted out of a Wayne Enterprises board meeting at Daggett&#39;s behest. As he leaves the building, he finds his car being towed. Blake shows up and offers Bruce a ride.Daggett is not happy that Miranda Tate was appointed to the board, and when he returns to his apartment, he demands to see Bane. Stryver hesitates, but Bane suddenly appears behind Daggett. Daggett turns his anger on Bane, not happy that Bane&#39;s attack on the stock exchange didn&#39;t help Daggett take over Wayne Enterprises, and furthermore, is not happy about the fact that Bane also has been working Daggett&#39;s construction crews around the clock all across the city for unknown purposes. Bane dismisses Stryver, calmly and casually revealing that the small fortune Daggett paid him does not give him complete power over him, and it was only for the construction machinery that he required to build the sophisticated underground sewers and accomplish his own future plans that he complied with Daggett&#39;s orders, which render him Gotham&#39;s reckoning. Daggett calls Bane pure evil, but Bane replies that he is &#34;necessary evil&#34; and he breaks Daggett&#39;s neck. He then has the body thrown in a dumpster.Blake shows up at the hospital while Foley is talking to Gordon, to report the discovery of Daggett&#39;s body. He has files that show Daggett&#39;s name all over construction permits for underground digging across the city, which make him suspect that Daggett was somehow associated with Bane. Foley still is skeptical of Bane&#39;s existence, but Gordon, impressed with Blake&#39;s honesty and hard work, promotes him to detective, telling him he&#39;s not allowed to believe in coincidences anymore.Bruce finds Selina at her apartment and says his powerful friend needs her help. He says he knows about the Clean Slate program and he has it. Selina says she&#39;ll think about it. She apologizes to Bruce about him losing all of his money in Bane&#39;s attack.When Bruce arrives home in a cab, he finds Miranda there. Bruce finds he doesn&#39;t have any keys, so they break into the house through a window. Bruce&#39;s electricity is off, as he can&#39;t afford it anymore. As they sleep together, Miranda talks about how fire made her family feel rich when they were growing up. Bruce notices a scar on her shoulder, which she calls a mistake.While Miranda is sleeping, Bruce sneaks down to the Batcave, puts on his Batsuit, and goes to meet with Selina, who says that Wayne wasn&#39;t lying about his powerful friend. They take out a couple of mercenaries on the way. As Batman steps onto a catwalk, a grate slams shut, and Selina admits that she had to keep Bane&#39;s men from killing her. Batman is telling her she&#39;s made a mistake when Bane appears behind him. Batman isn&#39;t surprised when Bane reveals that he knows that it&#39;s Bruce underneath the mask. Bane must know Bruce&#39;s identity through the League of Shadows. Although he was excommunicated before Bruce&#39;s arrival and training, Bane claims that now, he is the League of Shadows, and must have had the information of Bruce&#39;s alter ego reported to him through one of the members of the League who survived the assault on Gotham in Batman Begins.A lengthy battle of hand-to-hand combat between the two ensues. Bruce appears to be more aggressive and offensive than his usual sense, knowing the strength of his opponent. Bane begins to defeat Bruce, who tries several diversions, like flashbangs and disabling the lights, but these prove useless against a trained League of Shadows member like Bane, who mocks his tactics. Bane beats Bruce into submission, breaking his cowl with a few blows to his head. As Bruce lies prone, Bane reveals where he has established his base. One of his men hands him a detonator, and upon pressing it, explosions go off and a Tumbler falls through the ceiling, revealing that Bane has set up his base underneath Wayne Enterprises&#39; Applied Sciences office. Bane is Batman&#39;s most formidable enemy because he targets Bruce Wayne directly and uses Wayne&#39;s resources against the city of Gotham. As henchmen climb up ropes to raid Applied Sciences and capture Bruce&#39;s armory, Bruce engages Bane again, but is beaten down again. Bane lifts Batman over his head and brings him down brutally on his knee, breaking his back. Bane tears off the broken section of Batman&#39;s cowl and drops it, victorious. Selina, shocked that she just sent Bruce to his doom, slinks off as mercenaries grab Bruce and drag him away.The scene cuts to the next morning. Blake knocks on Wayne Manor&#39;s front door, looking for Bruce, but finding no one home, he goes into the city, and while sitting his car, he spots Selina getting into a cab. Recognizing her from the shootout at the bar, he tails her to the airport. Noticing the increased police presence, she ducks into an off-limits area. A uniformed officer spots her and asks to see her boarding pass. Selina hands the cop her hat and pretends to check her purse, then punches him. As she is walking down the jet bridge, Blake comes out of a door in front of her, flashing his badge.Blake talks to Selina in an airport office, asking her why she&#39;s trying to run. He is able to determine that she&#39;s trying to escape from Bane. Selina says she&#39;s not sure if Batman is alive, given what she saw of his fight with Bane. She is then arrested, and placed in Blackgate prison.Meanwhile, Bruce wakes up in a foreign prison, in pain from the fight. As he is regaining consciousness, he sees Bane standing over him. The prison sits at the bottom of a deep circular shaft, with the only way in or out being by climbing the stone walls. When Bruce asks Bane why he did not just kill him, Bane taunts Bruce that he intends to kill his soul first, making him witness Gotham City&#39;s downfall. Bane promises Bruce that he&#39;ll live at least long enough to see Gotham destroyed, and that only when he is done, and Gotham is ashes, will he give Bruce permission to die (implied to be that he will have a prisoner shank Bruce once Gotham falls).The prison is where Bane claims to have been born, and it is notorious as a &#34;Hell on Earth&#34;, from which nobody has managed to escape. However, one of the prisoners (Tony Amen) tells Bruce that a child had managed to escape. The child was born of a mercenary, who fell in love with a warlord&#39;s daughter. The mercenary was sentenced to life in the prison, but the daughter made a deal with her father to free him and instead ended up a prisoner there herself. One day a riot broke out in the prison. She was raped and murdered, but her child escaped. Bruce concludes that the child must have been Bane.While in his cell, Bruce sees several prisoners attempt to escape by using a rope, and climbing up the shaft towards the light, but fail to clear the final jump on to a ledge required to escape, instead falling and being slung into the brick walls on the sides of the shaft, severely wounding them.Back in Gotham, Miranda and Fox arrive at Wayne Enterprises for a board meeting on the reactor project. They enter the board room....to find Bane and his men holding the board of directors hostage. Bane welcomes Fox and asks him to nominate another board member to come with him. Fredericks, another board member, volunteers before Fox can name a nominee. Bane and his men take Fox, Miranda and Fredericks down through the hole in Applied Sciences. As he is led along, Fox is horrified watching henchmen fixing parts on the Tumblers.Blake is talking with Gordon at the hospital about Batman&#39;s disappearance when Foley bursts in and informs him of Bane&#39;s latest move. This is the last straw for Gordon. He immediately orders Foley to send every available cop to search the sewers to smoke out Bane and his men, on (at Blake&#39;s suggestion) the pretense that they&#39;re performing a &#39;training exercise&#39; (so as to avoid causing panic). Foley apologizes to Gordon for not taking him seriously earlier, and departs. Blake prepares to leave with Foley, but Gordon holds him back and orders him to look up Daggett&#39;s leads instead.Foley oversees the operation from outside a subway tunnel portal, and watches as officers of every rank walk into the tunnel, not knowing that it will be a long time before they will see daylight again. Elsewhere, teams assemble at subway stations, sewer portals, manhole covers, and drainage pipes and descend into the tunnels, searching for Bane and his men.Bane and his men lead Miranda, Fox, and Fredericks into a tunnel, where Fox and Miranda notice Dr. Pavel. They arrive at a dead end where henchmen plant explosive charges into a wall. Bane gives a nod, and all of the henchmen cover their ears as the wall is blasted, clearing a path into the reactor chamber. The explosion echoes through the underground tunnel network, audible to cops searching tunnels elsewhere in the city. Inside the chamber, Bane orders Fox to turn the reactor on. Fox refuses, so Bane signals for Barsad to hold a pistol to Fredericks&#39; head. After Miranda pleads with him to cooperate, she and Fox put their hands on a handprint scanner to turn on the reactor. Bane then orders his men to take the three board members back to the surface.Blake drives around in his unmarked unit, logging Daggett&#39;s cement plants and locations they&#39;ve done construction in. He is talking on his cell phone with Gordon, who tells him to keep looking deeper. He then pulls up to a cement plant.In the reactor plant, Dr. Pavel completes his work - converting the reactor into a four megaton nuclear bomb. Bane orders his men to remove the reactor&#39;s core, which Dr. Pavel objects to - removing the core will render the bomb unstable and cause it to melt down within five months - until Bane threatens to harm Dr. Pavel&#39;s family if he doesn&#39;t cooperate.As he walks through the cement plant, Blake recognizes one of the construction workers as the cement truck driver whose truck prevented the police from getting closer to the stock exchange during the raid. Blake mentions that he is not allowed to believe in coincidences. On cue, the driver&#39;s colleague tries to swing a knife at him. Blake twists the guy&#39;s arm and shoots him. The driver grabs Blake from behind, and after a struggle, Blake fires his gun at the truck. The bullet ricochets off the barrel and hits the driver in the back. Blake tries to get the driver to reveal what he&#39;s working on, but it is too late - the man has died. Blake is disgusted with his use of lethal force and tosses his pistol away. When he gets out his cell phone and leaves a message for Gordon, Blake notices barrels of polyisobutylene and motor oil, and realizes that using Daggett&#39;s construction crews, Bane has rigged numerous construction areas around the city with C4 explosive charges.As he drives away from the cement plant, Blake gets on his radio and warns Foley that the cops are about to head into a trap. Foley immediately yells to the watch commanders with him to start withdrawing the officers under their charge.Meanwhile, the mayor shows up at Heinz Field to watch the Gotham Rogues play against the Rapid City Monuments. He heads to his private box after shrugging off reporters asking him about cops heading underground, using the training exercise story Blake suggested to Foley.As cops search the tunnels, Bane and his men arrive at the stadium, breaking in through the boiler room, and take up positions in the locker room tunnel as a young boy sings the national anthem. All of them are carrying detonators in their hands. During the national anthem, numerous Rogues players are seen, ready to take the field, including Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, Wide Receivers Mike Wallace and Hines Ward, Safety Troy Polamalu, and Tight End Heath Miller, along with former Steelers coach Bill Cowher. When Bane catches the child&#39;s singing, he comments, &#34;That&#39;s a lovely, lovely voice.&#34;At the end of the song, Rapid City kicker Ravenstahl (Pittsburgh&#39;s own mayor Luke Ravenstahl in a cameo appearance) kicks off to begin the first quarter. Bane comments, &#34;Let the games begin!&#34; and presses the button on a remote control detonator. Several different events occur simultaneously:--In the tunnels, officers stop when they hear booms. As they are trying to register and identify the noise, portions of the ceilings across the sewer and subway system collapse, trapping them underground.--A series of large explosions rip through Manhattan, destroying buildings and infrastructure alike. Bridges leading up to the city, with the exception of the Queensboro Bridge, are destroyed by Bane&#39;s explosives, trapping the entire population of the city inside.--Blake is driving down another street, siren wailing, when the street starts to blow up. Street lamps, buildings, and telephone poles collapse all around his car, while other vehicles are tossed. He manages to stay ahead of the explosives for a short amount of time until one blast causes his car to flip over once before landing upright on its wheels, demolished.Once he comes to his senses, Blake gets on the radio with Foley, who confirms Blake&#39;s predictions: every cop in the city is trapped in the tunnels. But Blake realizes that not every cop is stuck down there, and realizes that Bane will try to assassinate Gordon. Unfortunately, his car has been demolished. With no other option, Blake grabs a shotgun from the trunk of his car, and commandeers an SUV from another uninjured motorist.Two of Bane&#39;s henchmen arrive at the hospital, searching for Gordon. They fire short bursts with their submachine guns as they enter the lobby, causing patients and guards to take cover. As they search the hospital, Gordon is alerted to their presence when the power goes out and the hospital switches to emergency lighting. He climbs out of his bed.Outside, Blake screeches to a halt and runs through the lobby. As he searches the corridor, he hears gunshots. He runs to Gordon&#39;s room, draws his shotgun, and kicks down the door, to discover that Gordon has already killed the two henchmen. Blake only has a second to register this before Gordon puts a pistol to the back of his head and orders him to get his coat.--At Heinz Field, wide receiver Hines Ward is running the ball down the field when explosions go off in the support columns to the foundation, causing the field to collapse and swallow the players, except for Ward, who manages to run the ball to the end zone for a touchdown, only noticing the destruction when he looks behind him. An additional bomb goes off in the mayor&#39;s box, incinerating him and his aides. As the debris settles, Bane&#39;s men storm the bleachers, taking the crowd hostage, while Bane, Barsad and other mercenaries march onto the remains of the field. He declares to the crowd that he and his men have come to liberate Gotham. He displays the fusion reactor core, calling it the &#34;instrument of their liberation&#34; and &#34;interviews&#34; Dr. Pavel in front of the shocked audience. After getting Dr. Pavel to admit that he is the only person who knows how to disarm the bomb, Bane thanks him, then breaks Dr. Pavel&#39;s neck. Bane also declares that he has left one citizen in charge of the detonator who will trigger the bomb in case of any sort of civil rebellion. Bane also threatens the government forces that should anybody try to enter or leave the city, he will detonate the nuclear weapon, thus forcing the government forces to guard the city and stop anybody from leaving.The Queensboro Bridge is left intact as a means to provide food and supplies to Gotham&#39;s citizens.As Blake drives to his apartment with Gordon, Gordon says he has to get in front of a camera, but Blake discourages him, saying that Bane will shoot him if he shows his face.The next day, Bane proceeds to Blackgate Prison, where more than 1,000 prisoners have been incarcerated as per the Dent Act, which gave power to the police. He reads out Gordon&#39;s speech revealing the truth about Harvey Dent, and declares the prisoners free, as the man who drew up the Dent Act himself was a murderer and a madman.The prisoners join Bane and together enforce what Bane calls &#34;martial law&#34;: forcing the elite out of their homes, holding kangaroo courts presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) and offering them a choice: exile or death. &#34;Exile&#34; means being forced to walk on the frozen East River underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, where the ice cracks and drowns anyone making the crossing. &#34;Death&#34; is revealed to be the same thing, as those who choose it get sentenced to &#34;death by exile.&#34;84 days into the siege, the Army slips an intelligence team into Gotham disguised as relief workers, under the command of Captain Mark Jones (Daniel Sunjata). They meet with Gordon, Foley, Blake, and some other cops who managed to escape being trapped underground. The soldiers, Blake, and the surviving cops begin tracking three military trucks, one of which carries the nuclear weapon (they can&#39;t tell which one has the bomb because they all have lead-lined roofs). To avoid detection of the weapon, the three trucks are being driven around the city continuously.Blake takes Jones and his men to a Wayne Enterprises office that Fox and Miranda are sheltered in. Miranda takes responsibility for the creation of the reactor which the bomb was molded from. Fox explains that as the reactor&#39;s cells deteriorate, the reactor will become very unstable, and regardless of what happens, the bomb will go off in three weeks. Fox admits that he could reconnect the core to the reactor to re-stabilize it. Blake prepares to leave with Jones, but Jones orders him to stay with Fox and Miranda while he goes to call in a report.Unfortunately, someone has betrayed Jones and his team, for just as they are leaving the hideout, a group of Bane&#39;s henchmen ambush them and open fire on them. Blake and Miranda quickly escape by slipping out a back door, while Fox is captured by a henchman. Jones&#39; team draws their weapons and begin shooting back, but prove no match for Bane&#39;s men, and they are shot dead. When Jones breaks cover and tries to flee, he is shot in the chest and falls. As he lies on the ground, Bane appears over him. Jones says he&#39;ll die before he can talk to his commander. Bane assures him, &#34;I&#39;m on your schedule, captain,&#34; and crushes Jones&#39;s neck. Bane orders his men to round up Fox and the others for judgment and to hang the soldiers&#39; bodies from one of the bridges as a message for the world.All this time, Bruce, holed up in the prison, is watching the havoc in Gotham on a TV set in the prison. He gets the doctor there to crudely fix his back; as his fight with Bane partially dislocated his vertebrae. The doctor puts Bruce into a crude form of traction and pushes the vertebrae back into place. The doctor tells Bruce to remain in that position until he can stand by himself. Enduring the pain, Bruce hallucinates that he sees Ra&#39;s Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) who proclaims his immortality. As the days wear on in the prison, Bruce&#39;s anger builds, and he is determined to save Gotham. He rigorously trains his body with pullups, pushups, and situps and he attempts to make the escape with the rope twice, but fails each time.After the second attempt, Bruce questions how a child could have escaped, but he could not. The doctor explains that while paradoxically, it seems as if having no fear of death should enhance his escape chances, in reality the human trait of fearing death is the necessary ingredient. There are suggestions that Bruce--in his grief over Rachel&#39;s death, physical disability, 8-year retirement from his Batman persona, and isolation-- is inured to mortality. He seems to have the death wish that Alfred had tried to remedy earlier with the shock of his leaving Bruce. Bruce solves the dilemma in replying that he fears dying in prison when the people of Gotham can only be saved by him if he were to escape. He realizes that the child had escaped without the safety rope, and chooses not to use the rope in his third attempt. Bruce reveals his confidence by packing supplies for himself in a bag. He begins the climb to the Arabic chants of &#34;Deshi deshi basara basara&#34; meaning &#34;Rise.&#34; When he reaches the pivotal point, requiring the jump, a stream of bats flows from a tunnel inside the cave and startle him, but increase his confidence. Bruce takes the jump and latches onto the protruding rock and succeeds in his final attempt. He subsequently throws down a rope from the top, allowing all the current prisoners to escape as well.Bruce returns to Gotham as Batman. He manages to gain trust from Selina after he catches her in the act of beating up two gangbangers trying to harm a young boy by offering her the Clean Slate program; Selina accepts. Bruce gets to Miranda and Fox by letting Bane&#39;s men capture him, as Fox has access to Bruce&#39;s backup Batsuit. To escape, Selina comes in and declares to the mercenaries that Bane wants Bruce and Fox by themselves. She knocks out the mercenaries and undoes their handcuffs. Fox tells Bruce he&#39;s found a nice girlfriend and Selina says, &#34;He should be so lucky&#34;.Once Fox has put Bruce in his Batsuit, and Bruce has found the Bat, he saves Gordon and some of the surviving cops after they are captured and are forced to cross the frozen river, simultaneously lighting a huge Batman symbol which lets everyone in Gotham know that he is back. When Bane sees the symbol he states, &#34;Impossible. Keep her close (pointing at Miranda). He&#39;ll come for her.&#34; Fox reveals that trigger or no trigger, the nuclear device is unstable and will detonate anyway the next day, and recovers a signal jammer from the Bat which can block the signals from the trigger.With Blake and Selina&#39;s help, Batman frees the police trapped in the sewers by using the Bat to destroy debris blocking the tunnels, and rescues Blake after he is captured trying to rescue cops through a manhole cover.The next morning, the rallied police forces, led by Foley, assemble on Wall Street, facing against Bane&#39;s army. One of Bane&#39;s men gets on a megaphone and orders the cops to disperse or be shot at. Foley replies back, &#34;There&#39;s only one police in this town!&#34; Bane orders his Tumblers to open fire, but as one of the Tumblers prepares to blast the cops with its cannons, the Bat appears and disables the cannons. As it flies off, the incited cops cheer and rush Bane&#39;s men. Physical combat ensues between Bane&#39;s men and the cops.Batman fights Bane again, with more success. He punches Bane&#39;s mask, detaching some of the tubes on his mask that feed Bane his anesthetic, which weakens him greatly, angers the villain, and forces Bane into the offensive. Batman avoids blow after blow and then lands a series of furious punches on Bane&#39;s mask and body, culminating with a roundhouse kick that sends Bane to the floor. When Bane asks him how he escaped and came back, stating &#34;I broke you,&#34; Batman tries to force Bane to reveal the location of the trigger device stating, &#34;Tell me where the trigger is. Then you have my permission to die,&#34; appropriately using Bane&#39;s own phrase against him. After Batman tells Bane that he is not the only person who can escape from that prison, Miranda suddenly stabs Batman in the side in a soft spot in the suit with her dagger sliding dangerously between his ribs.It is then revealed that &#34;Miranda&#34;&#39;s real name is Talia, and that she was the child who escaped from the Hell on Earth prison. Bane had been a prisoner there and her protector. During the prison riot that claimed her mother&#39;s life, Bane helped her escape, but in the process was hurt severely. The prison doctor attempted to repair the damage, but his methods resulted in Bane needing anesthetics to constantly keep the pain at bay.After she escaped, Talia tracked down her father: Ra&#39;s Al Ghul. She convinced her father to rescue Bane, and both were trained within the League of Shadows. Apart from the realization that Bane was an extremist monster, the injuries inflicted on Bane&#39;s face became a reminiscence of the suffering endured by Talia&#39;s mother in the pit for Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, which was why Bane was excommunicated from the group. Talia&#39;s intention is to take revenge on Batman for killing her father, as well as finishing the mission of destroying Gotham for its greed that cost her father&#39;s life. She hits the trigger of the nuclear weapon, but Gordon has managed to fit the signal jammer on the weapon just in time. However, there are only eleven minutes left for the nuke to detonate. Miranda/Talia says farewell and leaves Bane to kill Batman.As Bane is about to execute Batman with a shotgun, Selina crashes into the lobby on the Batpod and mortally wounds Bane by blasting him with the Pod&#39;s large cannon. Talia and Barsad walk out to the Tumblers. As they are climbing in, Barsad is shot dead by Foley with a submachine gun as he fires from outside the stock exchange. He and several other officers are killed when Talia orders her Tumbler&#39;s driver to gun them down. She takes control of the truck carrying the weapon, but her escorts are finished off in a prolonged chase sequence, with Selina riding the Batpod and Batman flying the Bat in the air, and attacking the convoy. Talia&#39;s truck goes off the road and crashes, and she is fatally wounded because she isn&#39;t wearing a seatbelt. In her last moments alive, she explains how her access to the reactor chamber allowed her to set a timer to flood it, preventing the weapon from being returned there. She dies believing she had finally completed her father&#39;s work and avenged his death.Fox escapes the flooding chamber and realizes there is no way of stabilizing the weapon. The weapon cannot be deactivated, and will detonate in less than 2 minutes. Batman explains that the Bat has no autopilot, and that he will need to fly the bomb out of Gotham. Batman shares a kiss with Selina, before revealing to Gordon his true identity: He says that a true hero puts a coat on a young boy after his parents are killed, and says, &#34;it&#39;s going to be alright son,&#34; as Gordon does to Bruce in Batman Begins. As he exits, Gordon says his true name.With not much time left, Batman attaches the bomb to the Bat, and flies it away from the city, and out over the bay. The citizens of Gotham watch as the weapon detonates on the horizon, and the mushroom-cloud balloons over the bay.In the aftermath, the police recapture all of those released by Bane.A private funeral is held on the grounds of Wayne Manor for Bruce, by those who knew his true identity (including Gordon and Blake). Alfred sobs quietly, feeling that he let Bruce&#39;s parents down by not protecting him.Blake resigns from the police force, and explains to Gordon that Gotham will never really know who saved it. Gordon tells him that they will know that it was &#39;The Batman&#39; who saved them. In tribute, a statue has been erected in Batman&#39;s memory.In the aftermath of Bruce Wayne&#39;s death, certain provisions are made. The majority of the estate is sold, with the money given to Alfred. Wayne Manor is given to the city of Gotham, as a place for orphaned boys to stay. Strangely, one of the Wayne family&#39;s treasures (a string of pearls) cannot be located.Blake is also given a duffel bag as part of Bruce&#39;s will. When presenting his I.D., the clerk who checks it suggests that he go by his real first name as it appears on his I.D.: Robin.Back in Applied Sciences, Lucius has workers go over the second camouflage rotor(The Bat) in the underground storage area. Wanting to know what he could have done to get the autopilot functioning, he is surprised when the workers explain that the autopilot is functional, and the computer log shows that Bruce Wayne made the changes 6 months prior.Up on the roof of Gotham&#39;s Police Department, Gordon finds the once broken Batsignal (destroyed by him personally by the end of the second movie) repaired.Meanwhile, Blake has opened the duffel bag, and finds a spelunking rope, and GPS coordinates. The information leads him to a waterfall (the entrance to the batcave). He makes his way past the waterfall, and into the cave, where his light attracts a flurry of bats. The light he uses, given to him by Wayne, is the same the Bruce uses when he first enters the cave in Batman Begins.In Florence, Italy, Alfred has returned to the restaurant that he had visited during Bruce&#39;s absence long ago. As he scans the tables, he sees Bruce and Selina at a nearby table and smiles. A fleeting glance between both Alfred and Bruce is enough to assure the other that each of them will be alright. After Bruce had attached the bomb to the Bat and taken off, he ejected with an escape pod to distance himself from the explosion and allowed the autopilot to continue to transport the bomb. There is a shot of Batman in a flying vehicle with a timer at five seconds, leading viewers to believe the explosion killed him, but Batman was not in the Bat carrying the bomb and was not within the blast radius of the bomb in that time-frame.In the final shot, we see Blake walking over a pool of water. As he does so, his movement activates the black flooring containing the batsuit. Blake stares around him as the flooring rises up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |8.4   |2012-07-20  |tt1345836|
|2h 16min|[Action, Adventure, Romance]|Lincoln Six Echo is just like everyone else - he&#39;s waiting to go to the Island, the only place left in the world to actually live a life. Thousands of people stay at a facility waiting to go to the Island. It all sounds like paradise, but Lincoln Six Echo soon discovers that there&#39;s actually a sinister purpose going on at that facility and that he must escape - but not before stopping the sinister plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |The Island begins with a montage of dream scene sequences, and a resonant male voice saying &#34;You&#39;re special. You have a very special purpose in life. You&#39;ve been chosen. The Island awaits you.&#34;Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) snaps awake from his dream. An LED display above him on the ceiling of his room announces the detection of an erratic sleep cycle. As he sits up, another display on his wall requests his presence at the tranquility center for a wellness evaluation, but Six Echo is upset at this, because he feels fine.The amount of control Lincoln Six Echo has over his life is shown plainly as he goes to the bathroom-- his toilet analyses his urine and announces an excess of sodium, which leads to a recommendation of nutrition control. Lincoln Six Echo dwells in a tightly controlled compound, where he is treated well, but subject to much more regimentation than he cares for. He puts a bracelet around his wrist to a scanner on the wall, and drawers open with fresh clothes-- a white track suit, socks and sneakers.Lincoln Six Echo steps outside of his room and touches his bracelet to a scanner just outside the door, to lock it. As he begins walking down the hall, a number of other citizens attired in identical looking tracksuits and sneakers are also walking along the hallway. He gets into a lift with a number of these people, and an automated voice announces the date as July 19, 2019.As the lift continues down, holograms play along the walls announcing a Lottery, and snapshots of a beautiful, tranquil island among sparkling blue ocean. A beautiful young woman announces the winner of the latest Lottery as Starkweather Two Delta. He&#39;s been chosen to be taken to a place known as The Island. An image of Starkweather Two Delta (Michael Clarke Duncan) appears, speaking joyfully and giddily about his dream come true. He&#39;s only dwelt among the citizens of the compound for six months. He encourages everyone to believe in the dream and that they&#39;ll be joining him on this island soon. One citizen in the lift, however, Gandu Three Echo (Brian Stepanek) is upset, however, and pounds a fist against one wall. This is immediately noticed by compound supervisors watching a series of monitors. As the Community Announcer (Noa Tishby) speaks about The Island, the last place on Earth free of a deadly pathogen, Gandu Three Echo asks a few other citizens how long they&#39;d been with the compound-- he&#39;s been there seven years without ever winning the Lottery, and he&#39;s not happy.As the lift reaches its destination, two compound supervisors, in black tracksuits and headsets, make Gandu Three Echo swipe his bracelet against portable scanners they carry, and note he&#39;s been cited for public disturbance before. They insist on seeing for themselves that he&#39;s adequately calmed down before letting he and the other occupants of the lift go on their way.Lincoln Six Echo continues walking through the compound&#39;s plazas, and we see citizens engaging in various fitness and yoga activities, and swimming in a pool. All seem content, but black-tracksuited supervisors are shown keeping close watch all throughout. The citizens of the compound, all of whom wear white tracksuits, are treated well, but their lives are strictly regimented and regulated. The Community Announcer&#39;s voice recites regular mantras such as citizens being requested to be polite, pleasant and peaceful, and that health brings happiness.At the cafeteria, Lincoln Six Echo swipes his bracelet, and the nutritionist announces that his available choices for the day&#39;s breakfast are fruit, oatmeal, and bran, based on continuing monitoring of his nutrient levels. Lincoln Six Echo is unhappy about this, looking for some degree of fuller, sweeter-tasting breakfast, bu the nutritionist doesn&#39;t budge and takes his demeanor with displeasure. She dispenses a gruel-like oatmeal onto his tray with some fruit and berries and sarcastically says, &#34;Yummy.&#34;Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s best friend in the compound, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) sidles up to him and tells him to &#34;watch and learn.&#34; She engages the nutritionist in friendly small talk, buttering her up with a pleasant smile. Jordan Two Delta&#39;s available choices for the day are powdered eggs, dried fruit and yogurt, but her charm pays off as the nutritionist lets her &#39;cheat&#39; with a serving of bacon. Jordan Two Delta shares the bacon with Lincoln Six Echo, teasingly saying he needs all his strength for tonight, where she promises to go easy on him. A supervisor comes up and politely asks for them to separate.Lincoln Six Echo walks past an education room where citizens are reading a surprisingly basic children&#39;s book aloud in unison. He arrives at the office of Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), the presiding doctor for the compound. Dr. Merrick questions Lincoln Six Echo about his friendship with Jordan Two Delta-- friendships with other citizens is freely encouraged, but there are proximity rules against regular close-up contact, especially between male and female citizens, whose living quarters are separate from each other. Furthermore, Dr. Merrick is aware that Lincoln Six Echo is being haunted by nightmares while sleeping, and Dr. Merrick says he&#39;d like to know more about them. Lincoln Six Echo says in the dream, he&#39;s riding on a beautiful boat toward the Island (he draws a sketch of the boat on request), but he&#39;s hurled into the ocean by some unseen figure and drowns. Dr. Merrick probes further into what&#39;s troubling Lincoln Six Echo, and he finally explains how he&#39;s begun questioning the regimentation of life at the compound-- why is Tuesday night &#39;tofu night?&#39; He wants some bacon with his breakfast, and he wants to wear different colors other than white for his clothes-- not to mention, who cleans and folds his clothes and places them neatly back in his drawer? And there should be more to life at the compound than just waiting to go the Island.Dr. Merrick calmly tries to explain that Lincoln Six Echo is lucky to have survived the contamination that left so much of the Earth uninhabitable, and there&#39;s one pristine spot remaining for people to repopulate the planet-- that&#39;s their current purpose, Dr. Merrick says. Although, as Dr. Merrick explains, he himself, and all other staff and supervisors at the compound, are ineligible to win the Lottery, and cannot ever go to The Island, as they are needed to keep the compound facility operating smoothly.Lincoln Six Echo finishes drawing a sketch of the boat-- it&#39;s a beautiful and well-rendered sketch, with the word Renovatio-- Lincoln Six Echo doesn&#39;t know what the word means, but it always appears in his dream. Dr. Merrick wants to run some medical tests on Lincoln Six Echo. He brings him into an examination room and seats him comfortable on a reclining seat-- but even though Dr. Merrick says the tests and scans are harmless, metal restraints snap shut, pinning Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s hands and feet, and keeping his head against the headrest. Dr. Merrick places a series of tiny robotic devices on Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s cheek, which crawl into his right eye socket between the eye and eyelids, and which hurts more than Dr. Merrick insists otherwise. He says the micro-sensors will ride along Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s optic nerve and upload data for twenty-four hours, after which they&#39;ll pass out of Lincoln Six Echo through his urine-- which Dr. Merrick admits, might hurt.Lincoln Six Echo arrives at the work center for work. He and a citizen named Jones Three Echo (Ethan Phillips) are using infuser tools to feed nutrients into tubes that lead to where the citizens&#39; meals are prepared. Lincoln Six Echo is bored with the job, although Jones Three Echo finds it satisfying.Gandu Three Echo points out a new citizen in the compound-- another survivor of the contamination that made Earth uninhabitable. More survivors are being found regularly, and the new arrival, named Seven Foxtrot, is being tutored on how to work at feeding the nutrient lines. His behavior is childlike, which Gandu Three Echo wonders, if all current citizens at the compound went through that during decontamination.Jones Three Echo suddenly begins telling the other two about a theory he has: that The Lottery is rigged. He produces some papers on which he&#39;s done some figuring on the idea. Through a complex series of mathematical equations which, in fact, don&#39;t make a lot of sense, Jones Three Echo predicts he&#39;s winning The Lottery that night.The calm of the work center is suddenly broken as a female citizen, Lima One Alpha, collapses. Lima One Alpha is heavily pregnant, and it appears she&#39;s gone into labor. The other women near her are ecstatic for her as a wheelchair is summoned; Lima One Alpha is now destined to go to the Island with her baby.The computer at Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s station goes down and he needs to report to Tech Services to get it repaired. A supervisor gives him a tri-key to retrieve a contamination kit, as the supervisor needs to help clean up from several glass beakers that Lima One Alpha dropped when she collapsed. Heading through a normally restricted area, Lincoln Six Echo heads through a supposedly contaminated area in Sector Six to visit a friend of his, James &#39;Mac&#39; McCord (Steve Buscemi); the down computer being a fabricated story. McCord likes Lincoln Six Echo and bends some compound rules for his sake, giving him a few glimpses of life beyond the compound proper. McCord lives in Sector Five of the compound, though he doesn&#39;t give details about it. Bringing Lincoln Six Echo into his private work station (which is covered with photos of young women clad in skimpy swimsuits), McCord talks a little about Dr. Merrick&#39;s perceived arrogance, comparing him to a concept Lincoln Six Echo has no understanding of-- God.McCord is needed in an area called Product Extraction. He lets Lincoln Six Echo stay in the work station for a short while, but needs to take back a small flask of a strange beverage he shares with Lincoln Six Echo; something he likes, although McCord doesn&#39;t feel comfortable telling him too much about it. Lincoln Six Echo asks McCord a fair amount of questions, which the older technician isn&#39;t comfortable about. Just what time McCord spends with Lincoln Six Echo can get him in a lot of trouble; as Lincoln Six Echo isn&#39;t supposed to be in Sector Six at all, in the first place.As McCord heads off to Product Extraction, Lincoln Six Echo glances up and sees a flying insect. Curious, he follows it; it seems to be following light from somewhere above. Lincoln Six Echo catches the insect and puts it in a matchbox on McCord&#39;s table; one that has a logo on it from something called &#39;Aces and Spades.&#39;McCord arrives in Product Extraction, asking two workers there a curious question-- &#34;Chinese junk (referring to the computers) locked up again?&#34; As he sets about to work, the workers are moving a plastic pod into position; one filled with fluid... in which floats a humanoid life form. McCord tries to work on the computer, but is finding himself very distasteful, and disturbed, at what the workers are doing-- the &#39;Product&#39; being &#39;Extracted&#39; from the pod is a fully grown male human, which a doctor says has been named Three Helo. Workers place a raised brand on Three Helo&#39;s wrist and then a bracelet around the wrist, over the brand.As workers finish the procedure and complete cleaning up, the camera pans through a window into a vast chamber where hundreds of similar pods are neatly organized... all containing humans in a state of stasis. The camera then rapidly pans along several arrays of technology leading back to Jones Three Echo still working on the nutrient lines-- it&#39;s shown that the tubes he tends to, are actually feeding nutrients to these humans still in the pods.Lincoln Six Echo goes back to his quarters, and places the insect from the matchbox into a glass vase.Evening, in a social center of the compound. Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta square off in a combat arena-- or rather, tri-dimensional holograms of them do, while the two of them manipulate these holograms in an elaborate combat game, using hand and arm movements to work the controls. Jordan Two Delta wins this game, her hologram knocking out Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s hologram; causing Lincoln Six Echo to be ridiculed by other male citizens for being &#39;beaten by a little girl&#39; as he joins Jordan Two Delta at the juice bar for some refreshment. As they talk, Jordan Two Delta asks Lincoln Six Echo how he feels. He says he feels fine, but Jordan Two Delta says that his face always gives him away when he lies-- his mouth smiles, but his eyes don&#39;t.Lincoln Six Echo tells Jordan Two Delta about the flying bug he found-- something that should have gone extinct with the pathogen, and yet came into the compound through a ventilation shaft without setting off any pathogen sensors. The insect is a little larger than Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s thumb, meaning it&#39;s not too small to evade the pathogen sensors. Lincoln Six Echo is wondering about more than just this-- how did it survive outside? And what about new human survivors; where do they come from? Even though Jordan Two Delta thinks it&#39;s good that new survivors are still being found. She&#39;s baffled at how Lincoln Six Echo is convinced of bad things being hidden behind the seeming good life at the compound. She does, however, want to see the insect Lincoln Six Echo found.After Jordan Two Delta walks away, Gandu Three Echo and Jones Three Echo find their way to Lincoln Six Echo-- Gandu Three Echo has picked up a curious new word from the censor: &#34;Dude.&#34; None of the three men understand this word, although they all think it sounds amusing. They also think it&#39;s spelled, &#39;dood.&#39;The walls in the social center light up with holographic displays as a Lottery begins. The Community Announcer begins the usual speech about the Lottery and a lucky winner heading to the Island. Citizens all around the compound stop and begin watching nearby monitors and screens.The winner of the Lottery is Jordan Two Delta. She stands up, her face frozen in stunned delight as people all around her begin to cheer and applaud. Lincoln Six Echo, however, is seen looking unhappy. Not only is he losing his best friend in the compound, but he still hasn&#39;t been chosen.Still, as he approaches her, he puts on a brave face and smiles at her. A supervisor&#39;s portable tablet lights up with their faces as a proximity warning; Lincoln Six Echo has touched Jordan Two Delta&#39;s arms with his own. Lincoln Six Echo tells Jordan Two Delta that she was right after all: good things do happen.The supervisor arrives to make them separate, spoiling the emotional goodbye that the two must bid each other.Lincoln Six Echo has the same nightmare again while sleeping. He awakes suddenly, leaning up to look at the flying insect. He still has the tri-key-- something he shouldn&#39;t have-- and his face lights up with an idea.All the citizens are asleep, so Lincoln Six Echo must sneak through the compound to avoid being spotted by a supervisor. He makes his way to the area of Sector Six where he found the insect-- an area normally restricted to level three supervisory personnel-- and releases the insect from the matchbox. He climbs a long ladder in the ventilation shaft, following the insect, and as he crawls through a crawlspace, he finds a loose paneling in the ceiling. Pushing it up, Lincoln Six Echo climbs up and out into a hallway in a medical sector. He ducks through a door, finding a utility closet with a number of blue medical lab coats; one of which he puts on. Lincoln Six Echo navigates his way through the medical center hallways until he arrives at a window to an ob/gyn room where doctors and nurses are with Lima One Alpha, who has just finished deliverying her baby. Lima One Alpha looks on, a tear of joy running down her face as she looks at the healthy baby girl.But the happy scene quickly takes a horrific dark turn as a doctor injects something into a drip attached to Lima One Alpha&#39;s arm, and the nurse closes velcro straps, binding Lima One Alpha&#39;s ankles to the stirrups on the table. Lima One Alpha&#39;s body begins shaking, and her breathing grows more rapid-- and she dies. A tag with her name has been placed around her big toe. Lincoln Six Echo watches in horror as a sheet is raised over Lima One Alpha&#39;s head; the doctor and nurse in the obstetrics chamber acting as if it&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary.Once the room is empty, Lincoln Six Echo sneaks inside, poking at Lima One Alpha&#39;s face; amazed that she&#39;d really been killed. Meanwhile, the nurse carries the baby into a &#39;client waiting room,&#39; and presents the baby to a man and woman who wait anxiously. The woman is a spitting image of Lima One Alpha. The nurse presents them with the baby, saying it&#39;s a beautiful girl. The nurse tells them that when they&#39;re ready, she has copies of their policy termination papers for their records.Lincoln Six Echo makes his way to a reception area for a nurse station. One nurse talks to two men in orange lab coats. The men are medical couriers, there about who the nurse excitedly asks is, &#39;Starkweather, the big, cute football player in the Reebok commercials.&#39; The two men are in a hurry to pick up something from this Starkweather; however, he&#39;s still in surgery.Starkweather Two Delta lays on an operating table in the surgery room, where a medical team is beginning surgery. As they start to make an incision through the chest and sternum, however, Starkweather Two Delta&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure begin to rise. Despite the medical team&#39;s efforts, Starkweather Two Delta awakens, throwing off the anesthesia, and goes into a panic as he starts to understand what&#39;s happening. Using his size and strength, he makes a desperate bid to escape, bulling over one guard as more pursue him. Starkweather Two Delta runs in a panic, a number of wires still attached to his body. Lincoln Six Echo ducks behind a mobile tray for cover.Guards fire harpoon guns; small, narrow barbed harpoons jabbing through the back of Starkweather Two Delta&#39;s calves. The harpoons are attached to cables that are used to drag him back toward the guards. A frantic Starkweather Two Delta pleads and screams for his life, though he does so in a surprisingly innocent, adolescent like manner. As Starkweather Two Delta is dragged back to the surgery room, where his liver is due to be removed, a guard notices Lincoln Six Echo, mistakes him for a nurse, and helps him up, assuring him it&#39;s not the first time something like that has happened. He then turns to a portable radio, telling &#39;Ether-Con&#39; that the &#39;product is secure.&#39;Lincoln Six Echo races back to the floor tile through which he&#39;d entered the medical sector, and ducks back down through it, closing it back up so hurriedly that he leaves the tile ajar; enough to be noticed.Guards at a security station are watching a video replay of Starkweather Two Delta&#39;s escape attempt; all of them laughing uproariously at the huge man&#39;s barreling down one guard during the attempt. At that moment, Dr. Merrick arrives to question the guards about the incident. He finds the report about the escape attempt a very serious matter and orders that the video footage be replayed for him. As he watches, something catches his eye, and he orders the tape stopped, and then replayed in slow motion, Dr. Merrick catches the fleeting image of what appears to be a medical nurse crouching in hiding behind a large mobile tray at the moment Starkweather Two Delta was recaptured. Dr. Merrick orders the camera to zoom in on this hiding nurse, and sees the bracelet worn by compound citizens. He quickly orders an alarm to be sounded; &#39;a product is on the loose.&#39; He orders a facial match scan to be run as guards scramble back to the area, called simply, &#39;Level 2.&#39;It&#39;s early morning. Jordan Two Delta awakens; her LED banner reading that she&#39;s scheduled for Island departure. Meanwhile, Lincoln Six Echo comes heading toward her quarters, in an area of the compound restricted to female residents. The other women stare in surprise, a few trying to tell him that men aren&#39;t supposed to be allowed in the women&#39;s quarters. Meanwhile, security personnel continue mobilizing; some grabbing weapons. Running through Level 2 in the medical sector, they find the loose floor tile that Lincoln Six Echo came through to get into the area.Lincoln Six Echo arrives at Jordan Two Delta&#39;s room and slaps frantically on the door. He grabs her wrist and urgently tells her only that she has to come with him.Security personnel positively identify Lincoln Six Echo as the trespasser. Dr. Merrick orders a full contamination lockdown so he can be found. They sweep the medical center; even barging in on the surgery area where Starkweather Two Delta&#39;s liver has been removed and is being packaged for transport-- and transplant.Dr. Merrick is questioning security on how Lincoln Six Echo got into the medical sector; he refers to him as an &#39;Agnate.&#39;Jordan Two Delta runs out of breath as Lincoln Six Echo hurries her through the compound. She reacts in fear and bewilderment as he hurriedly tells her that he saw Lima One Alpha and Starkweather Two Delta killed. Lincoln Six Echo is sure now that there is no Island; people winning the Lottery are brought into the medical sector to be killed, for reasons he still doesn&#39;t fully understand. As he continues running with Jordan, security cameras pick up his location in the female residential tower, with &#39;a female product in tow.&#39;In a general throughway area of the compound, citizens are walking about to various destinations when the Community Announcer comes on monitor display to declare the contamination alert, saying that anyone coming into contact with Lincoln Six Echo will be quarantined. Citizens scatter frantically as Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta race by, hotly pursued by security. Lincoln Six Echo takes Jordan Two Delta into Sector Six, throwing open the door and leaving it open, and the security personnel continue pursuit, radioing for backup.Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta run into a dead end; a gate closing off further flight. A guard catches up and begins savagely beating Lincoln Six Echo with a baton; in so doing, he turns his back to Jordan Two Delta, who, getting desperate, picks up a heavy wrench and bashes the guard from the blind side, knocking him out. Lincoln Six Echo pulls the lid off a ventilator, and he and Jordan Two Delta climb down into it. They fall through a shaft... into a vast conditioning room where newly extracted &#39;agnates&#39; lay on gurneys. A familiar voice plays on a recording loop, repeating such mantras as the agnates being special people, who have been chosen for a very special purpose, and their destiny is to go to The Island. Several small monitors above each agnate play video feeds of happy childhood scenes, and a powerful-looking, but smiling, man repeating the various mantras.Security converges again, continuing pursuit. Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta manage to summon a lift and escape in the nick of time. The lift takes them to a walkway on the exterior of the compound. They continue running, and Jordan Two Delta spots a door marked, &#39;containment blast door.&#39; As she struggles to pull it open, Lincoln Six Echo passes by an array of machinery marked, &#39;holographic power grid.&#39; He stares at it cor a few seconds until he turns to catch up with Jordan Two Delta. The two run through another underground corridor... and emerge from a military weapons silo into the outside world. Although the terrain is rocky, and looks barren except for sparse vegetation, they are very able to breathe the air. There&#39;s no trace of any contamination or pathogen. Jordan Two Delta knows now that Lincoln Six Echo was telling the truth about The Island being a lie.They run through a broken fence, staring in wonder at the world around them. The two know they aren&#39;t entirely safe, however; to say nothing of which, they will soon need to find food and water, and some sort of shelter to sleep under.Back in the compound, the Community Announcer delivers fabricated news reports to the agnates, that Lincoln Six Echo is still in quarantine after exposure to outside contamination, while Jordan Two Delta was transported to her new home on The Island. &#39;Life&#39; there has returned to normal, with one small exception: Jones Three Echo is concerned for his friend and tries to ask supervisors about him. He&#39;s also become curious enough to ask where the nutrient tubes go.The truth about this compound is revealed as Dr. Merrick makes a sales presentation to potential clients: Dr. Merrick runs the Merrick Institute, a bio-engineering facility where the Agnates are grown. An Agnate is a clone of a regular person; grown directly into adulthood, matching the biological age of the client; its DNA completely identical to the client&#39;s. Dr. Merrick falsely claims that the Agnates are kept in a vegetative state, never achieving consciousness, and never thinking or feeling, in full compliance with eugenics laws of 2015. An Agnate is meant as a source of replacement body parts for an ailing client; each Agnate being a perfect DNA match for its client, there is never worry about rejection of body parts, nor a need to wait for available organs, during which time the client could die. Female Agnates can also serve as surrogate wombs for a female client who cannot carry a baby to term, herself (Lima One Alpha). He stresses his false claim that Agnates do not achieve sentience, and are products; not human, as humans think of themselves as human.Dr. Merrick excuses himself, leaving the Institute&#39;s public relations director, Mr. Whitman, to continue the presentation for prospective clients. He then meets with a man named Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou), head of a private security firm called Blackhawk, that is highly recommended by the U.S. Defense Department. He&#39;s a former GIGN (French Special Forces) operative, and his men are all former U.S. Navy Seals or Delta Force. Dr. Merrick has told the U.S. Defense Department that a major corporate theft has occured, but he&#39;s seeking to hire Laurent because of something bigger; a high security breach.Dr. Merrick explains what the world, and especially the U.S. Defense Department, doesn&#39;t know: the Agnate products are alive, and sentient; without this, the organs in their bodies fail and are unsuitable for transplant into the client from whom they&#39;re cloned. Two products have escaped from the Institute, four hours prior. If knowledge of this, especially what Lincoln and Jordan truly are, becomes public, the Institute will be shut down for ethical violations; not to mention, the Defense Department would pull out the $120 billion it has invested in it. Laurent assures Dr. Merrick that he&#39;s fully confidential and has the tools to track and locate the missing Agnates.Lincoln and Jordan have reached the ruins of a building along a highway. Jordan is exhausted and can&#39;t run anymore. She wonders if maybe the contamination was real after all, but Lincoln finds a rattlesnake, a living thing, proof that there is no contamination or pathogen. They decide to rest inside the ruined building.Dr. Merrick is briefing Laurent on the missing Agnates and tells him about Agnate life in the Institute. He explains that locating Jordan Two Delta is particularly paramount. Her sponsor, Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car accident. Without multiple organ transplants, she&#39;ll die within three days. This explains the &#34;Lottery--&#34; An Agnate &#34;wins&#34; when their sponsor requires body part harvest. Lincoln Six Echo was the first Agnate to question his environment. Over the past several weeks and months, his behavior was growing more inconsistent with normal Agnate behavior. Agnates know very little about the real world outisde the Institute: They&#39;re controlled with shared memories of a global contamination that keeps them fearful of trying to go outside the Institute compound, except when they&#39;re &#34;chosen&#34; to go to &#34;The Island&#34; to help populate it. They&#39;re provided with simple work, media, games and books that keeps their psychological development equivalent to a 15-year-old adolescent, and their social skills simple, while also managing any natural aggressive tendences and eliminating any concept of sexuality (the proximity rule enforcement helping with this as well).Lincoln and Jordan are awakened by the sound of a motorcycle riding down the road. The driver doesn&#39;t notice them. Taking a second to gain their bearings, Lincoln happens to notice a road sign identifying the highway they&#39;re on as Route 39. Taking the matchbox out of his pocket, he sees that the &#34;Aces and Spades&#34; is also on Route 39, meaning McCord must live nearby. Lincoln and Jordan hurry down the road with renewed purpose.Lincloln and Jordan find the Aces and Spades; a sleazy bar on the side of the highway. They go in and ask the bartender about James McCord. The verbal slang used by people in the outside world puzzles and confounds the two of them, but the bartender tells them where McCord is (in the men&#39;s bathroom).Lincoln goes into the bathroom, and sees one of the stalls is occupied. McCord is dumbfounded as Lincoln pulls open the doors, grabs him and pushes him up against a wall. Lincoln angrily confronts McCord on knowing that the Island is a lie, and that Jordan was going to be killed instead of brought there. Lincoln demands that McCord tell him the full truth about the compound he and Jordan have escaped from. Completely flustered, McCord stomps out of the bathroom, collects Jordan (who&#39;s started to get drunk from the liquor she&#39;d been served) and brings she and Lincoln to his home.At McCord&#39;s house, he tells Lincoln and Jordan the truth about their existence; how they&#39;re human clones meant to serve as sources of body parts for the people they&#39;re cloned from. All they&#39;ve been told about their lives is meant to keep them from knowing the truth about themselves. The memories they have of their respective childhoods, families, and lives before the contamination are basic memory imprints (fine details having been &#34;lost&#34; after their &#34;exposure to contamination&#34;). McCord also explains their names: Lincoln and Jordan are the surnames of their sponsors. Echo means that Lincoln has been alive for three years, while Delta means Jordan is four. The Two in Jordan&#39;s name is a regional code for New York, where Sarah Jordan lives; Six is a regional code for Los Angeles, where Lincoln&#39;s sponsor, Tom Lincoln, lives.As to their existence... wealthy people are willing to pay large sums of money to extend their lifespans. Nobody knows that the Agnates are alive and sentient, especially not the sponsors from whom they&#39;re cloned. This is why the Institute is located in an old military bunker well below ground (the silo they emerged from during escape). Dr. Merrick is violating a great many laws and ethics codes to operate the Institute and provide the wealthy sponsors with the Agnate sources of replacement parts; this is the chief reason the truth about the whole operation is well kept from the world.Lincoln and Jordan decide that they must locate their sponsors and spread the truth of their existence and the Institute, so all the other Agnates, many of whom they consider close friends, will be able to live their lives. McCord is horrified at the decision, knowing that not only his own career, but even his life could be on the line. He tries to tell Lincoln and Jordan to simply run somewhere and try to make lives for themselves, but Lincoln makes clear that his and Jordan&#39;s decisions are made, and they&#39;ll do what they must with or without McCord&#39;s help, but they&#39;re appealing to him as a friend to help.Laurent and his team are on the ground and in helicopters. The local terrain&#39;s heat (The deserts outside of Tuscon, Arizona, as per the writing on McCord&#39;s matchbox) is interfering with infrared sensors trying to pick up Lincoln and Jordan&#39;s body heat signatures. Reading a medical profile on Lincoln, Laurent sees that Lincoln was implanted with micro-sensors for a synaptic scan. He has his men reconfigure their instruments to pick up the RF frequency emitted by these micro-sensors.McCord has clothed Lincoln and Jordan in regular street clothes and provided them with some cash and a credit card, although he warns them that they can only use the card for twenty four hours, after which he has to report it stolen or else the Institute will know he&#39;s been helping them. As he drives them down the road, Laurent&#39;s men pick up the RF signal from the micro-sensors in Lincoln&#39;s body.McCord has brought Lincoln and Jordan to an Amtrak station to put them on a train to Los Angeles. At the station, Lincoln passes the micro-sensors out of his body through his urine (as Dr. Merrick said he would). McCord gets train tickets for them to go to L.A. and tells them to go to an information directory on arrival, so they can learn where Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan live. He tells them to wait for a brief moment while he gets a map of Los Angeles from the upstairs level of the station.As McCord is getting the map, Laurent&#39;s team starts to infiltrate the station. They&#39;re dressed in street clothes to blend in with the people there. But one of them passes right by McCord as he&#39;s still at the map kiosk. McCord recognizes who the operative is and yells to Lincoln and Jordan to run. The operative, knowing he&#39;s been made, pulls a gun and shoots McCord point-blank in the chest, causing him to fall over the upper level railing and crash through the refreshment bar. Lincoln and Jordan take off running, weaving their way through private areas of the station and ending up in a tool shed, where Lincoln picks up a crowbar and Jordan a nail gun (Jordan doesn&#39;t know what it is, and almost kills Lincoln with it). They&#39;re alerted to one of Laurent&#39;s men closing in on them. They see the operative reaching his hand through a hole in the door in order to unlock it. Jordan puts the nail gun right up against his hand and fires several nails through the man&#39;s hand, nailing it to the inside of the door. Lincoln clubs him with the crowbar and they&#39;re running again. They make it aboard the train and settle into seats; Jordan thoroughly shaken at how McCord was murdered in cold blood.Laurent&#39;s men have identified McCord and pulled up all the information available about him. They note that his credit card is missing, shortly after he purchased two Amtrak train tickets with it. Laurent orders a trace on the card, and that the station be contacted in order to patch them through to the conductor for the train that McCord bought the tickets for. Laurent also gives an order for another team to be assembled in Los Angeles.The Institute&#39;s Incubation Chief hurries into Dr. Merrick&#39;s office. Dr. Merrick shows him the sketch Lincoln Six Echo drew of the boat. The boat has a name-- a Latin name: Renovatio. Agnates aren&#39;t imprinted with knowledge of Latin words. They need to figure out where Lincoln Six Echo came up with the word. His synaptic scan results are due shortly, but needed even sooner than that.Lincoln and Jordan arrive in Los Angeles. Along one building is a Reebok ad showing Jamal Starkweather, sponsor for Starkweather Two Delta; a big, brawny football player striking a mean pose with a mean look for the ad. As they walk through the streets of L.A. looking for an information directory, Lincoln and Jordan pass by a large advertisement display in the lobby of a building. Jordan turns and stares in amazement at-- herself. The ad is a Calvin Klein display featuring Sarah Jordan, who is a high-profile fashion model. Jordan watches, befuddled, as Sarah kisses a male actor on the television screen.Laurent and an L.A. Blackhawk team have arrived; one of the operatives, Troy, has already tapped into the city cameras. As several jet bikes and Black Wasp aerial vehicles are prepared, Troy finally makes facial matches on Lincoln and Jordan through the city&#39;s street cameras.Lincoln and Jordan find an information directory. Soon as they swipe McCord&#39;s credit card through the reader, Troy picks it up and identifies the location for Laurent. But Laurent&#39;s team has to move carefully; LAPD is also tracing McCord&#39;s credit card and have also picked up the usage.Lincoln and Jordan do a search on their sponsors. Tom Lincoln isn&#39;t listed in the directory, but Sarah Jordan is. The directory places a videophone call to Sarah&#39;s house. a small boy picks up the phone. When he turns to look at the monitor, he sees Jordan&#39;s face and asks in wonder, &#39;Mommy, is that you?&#39; Jordan is amazed; she&#39;s talking to her sponsor&#39;s young son.Lincoln notices Laurent and some of his men carefully trying to move in, but as Lincoln and Jordan try to run, LAPD arrives in force on the scene, taking the two of them into custody as suspects in McCord&#39;s murder. As the squad cars move back out, one of Lincoln&#39;s men pokes the barrel of a special rifle through a murder hole in the side of the armored car, and fires a tracking dart into the body of one of the squad cars.As Laurent and his team pursue the LAPD, Laurent reports in to Dr. Merrick. Laurent knows that DNA scans will be run on Lincoln and Jordan. Since their DNA perfectly matches those of their sponsors, Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan, once booked, these Institute clients will be implicated in a murder investigation. Dr. Merrick is furious. He tells Laurent that his team must retrieve the Agnates from the LAPD by any means necessary.And time is running out-- Lincoln tells one of the officers in the car he&#39;s in, that his name is Tom Lincoln. The officer runs the name through the car&#39;s computer system and pulls up Tom Lincoln&#39;s profile, including his address in San Pedro, CA.The squad car stops at a red light, and Laurent&#39;s armored truck sideswipes it from the intersection, smashing clear through it. As Lincoln and Jordan struggle to free themselves from the vehicle wreckage, more LAPD cars converge, forcing Laurent&#39;s men to exchange gunfire. But Laurent and one of his men make direct visual contact with Lincoln and Jordan, and their priorities shift to pursuing them.Lincoln and Jordan manage to climb aboard a passing Mack Truck carrying a large number of heavy wheel axles for trains. Laurent and his men, both on the ground and in Blackhawk helicopters, are in pursuit. They verify that Lincoln and Jordan are hiding underneath these axles and Laurent orders snipers to take them out. Lincoln and Jordan are unable to maneuver or crawl back through the axles. Lincoln manages to undo one of the clasps for the harnesses holding the axles in places on the cargo bay of the truck, sending them all tumbling down onto the highway. Despite desperate swerves and maneuvers to stay in pursuit, the wildly tumbling axles score direct hits on all of Laurent&#39;s pursuing ground vehicles, including the armored car in which Laurent himself rides. LAPD choppers are inbound, forcing the Blackhawk helicopters to withdraw from the scene.The one vehicle able to continue pursuit is the Black Wasp aerial jet bike. The gunner opens fire on the truck, taking out one of its wheels and forcing it to a stop. As the Black Wasp loops back around for another pass, Lincoln grabs a chain from the harness used to hold the axes. He hurls it out at the Black Wasp gunner. Disoriented by the attack, the Black Wasp rides too closely underneath an overhanging road sign. The gunnery portion of the Black Wasp is ripped off, and the pilot and gunner knocked unconscious on the road. As LAPD close in, Lincoln and Jordan climb aboard the Black Wasp. Lincoln manages to activate the vehicle and take off. A second Black Wasp follows in hot pursuit through the streets of the city, above the ground; weaving through aerial bridge footpaths and elevated trains.As the pursuing Black Wasp&#39;s attack computers homes in for a weapons lock, they suddenly collide with an elevated passenger train. Lincoln pulls up higher into the air, narrowly missing a Blackhawk helicopter. He crashes through the side of a high-rise building, careening through its interior, forcing office workers to leap and scramble for cover. Their Black Wasp smashes back out through the other side of the building, colliding with a scaffold for painters. Lincoln and Jordan are pitched from the vehicle, landing on a huge letter R attached to the side of the building, serving as its logo. Jordan dangles over the side of the logo, yelling in terror for Lincoln to hold on to her. Straining with all his strength, Lincoln pulls Jordan back up.Laurent tells his team that if they can&#39;t eliminate the fugitive Agnates quietly, to do it any way they can. Team members disguised as LAPD officers infiltrate the building as a Blackhawk chopper circles it. The agents on foot get on the roof of the building, both they and the chopper opening fire as Lincoln and Jordan struggle to stay hidden among the girders holding the logo against the side of the building. But to Laurent&#39;s consternation and horror, the gunfire breaks apart the moorings holding the logo against the building exterior. As the Blackhawk helicopter tries to maneuver for another shot, the logo tips over and crashes right on top of it, taking out its main rotor and sending it plunging to the ground alongside the huge letter R logo, seventy stories down, with Jordan and Lincoln struggling to cling to the logo. People on the ground scatter as flaming debris rains down.Lincoln and Jordan are thrown from the logo as it crashes through a network of chain-link fences used as part of a lattice of scaffolding for new construction. the fences arrest their fall and cushion them, enabling them to land safely; bruised and with a few cuts, but alive and with no serious injury.At the Institute, Dr. Merrick is speaking with Gandu Three Echo. Gandu Three Echo tells Dr. Merrick about how he suspects some kind of conspiracy. He heard about the flying bug Lincoln Six Echo found, which was why he thought he could leave the compound. From this news, and from something strange he suspects about the Lottery, Gandu Three Echo is wondering if the contamination is real or not. Distracting Gandu Three Echo with small talk, Dr. Merrick pulls a needle and terminates Gandu Three Echo with an injection of a lethal chemical. Turning to the security agents with him, Dr. Merrick orders a list of all the Echo-generation Agnates currently living at the Institute.Lincoln and Jordan have found a covered walkway that shelters them from the nighttime rain. Lincoln says he saw Tom Lincoln&#39;s address when the squad car pulled it up. They&#39;ll go there after the rain stops, and Lincoln feels that when his sponsor sees him, everything will be okay. Jordan asks Lincoln about Sarah&#39;s son. Although Lincoln tries to reassure her, Jordan sees right through him, as she always can-- he suspects Sarah Jordan is going to die. Jordan Two Delta feels bad for her, even though she&#39;s unprepared and unwilling to sacrifice her own life for her, and didn&#39;t ask to be created specifically for that purpose. Jordan starts to shiver from the chill in the air. Lincoln puts an arm around her shoulders, and she rests her head against his chest.The next day, Lincoln and Jordan get a ride to Tom Lincoln&#39;s estate. Lincoln peers into what looks like a security camera near the door; it reads his retinal prints, which are a match for his sponsor&#39;s; the door unlocks and opens for them. The two of them go inside and find photos of Tom Lincoln riding fast motorcycles and cars; images Lincoln recognizes. They also find a small model display of the Renovatio. At that moment, Tom Lincoln comes up from behind, mistaking them for intruders, and swings a golf club, though he freezes in shock and amazement when he sees Lincoln&#39;s face. Lincoln introduces himself to his sponsor, saying, &#39;I&#39;m your insurance policy.&#39; Tom Lincoln can only say, &#39;And what are you doing in my house?&#39;The Institute Incubation Chief hurries into Dr. Merrick&#39;s office with the synaptic scan results. Comparing them with scans of Lincoln Six Echo from just before he was integrated into the Agnate population, his memory patterns display thirty years of growth, rather than three. The Incubation Chief wonders if this is a result from some cortical infection, but Dr. Merrick knows better; an infection can&#39;t teach a person Latin, nor give them understanding of how to fly. Looking over the scan results with a critical eye, Dr. Merrick figures out what&#39;s happened. Lincoln Six Echo scan shows memories belonging not only to him... but to Tom Lincoln, his sponsor.Tom Lincoln is removing the Agnate bracelets from Lincoln and Jordan&#39;s wrists. He recognizes Jordan&#39;s face from the men&#39;s magazines Sarah Jordan has posed for. Under the bracelet is some kind of thermal sensor implant under the skin of Jordan&#39;s wrist. Tom Lincoln, of course, is more interested in Jordan herself, and is extremely amused to learn that Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s relationship with her has thus far been entirely platonic, and they don&#39;t know what sex is.Tom Lincoln, who unlike his Agnate, speaks with a Scottish accent, is a designer of fast, fancy boats, cars and motorcycles. He enjoys any kind of fast speed ride, and has made a fortune selling these designs to manufacturers. Renovatio, the name of the latest boat model he&#39;s been designing, is a Latin name that means Rebirth. Finally Tom Lincoln explains the reason for Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s existence. A life-long ladies&#39; man and philanderer, Tom Lincoln has cirrhotic hepatitis. In two years, his liver will begin failing. This means that Lincoln Six Echo himself would &#39;be chosen to go to the Island&#39; by that time, for organ harvest.Lincoln tells his sponsor that he and Jordan have come to him, hoping to expose the truth of the Institute to the public. Tom Lincoln says that he can&#39;t believe it himself, even though he&#39;s standing face to face with his own insurance policy. But Lincoln Six Echo happens to turn and sees a man on the television screen that he recognizes from the Agnate population at the Institute-- the very President of the United States has a clone at the Institute. Lincoln Six Echo understands that this man is giving a broadcast announcement to large groups of people. If he and Tom Lincoln can get onto the news together, the Institute will be exposed. Jordan tells Tom Lincoln that thousands of people, everyone she and Lincoln Six Echo know at the Institute, are going to die there. When Jordan takes Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s hand, Tom Lincoln finally smiles at her and says he just needs to get his shoes, and the&#39;ll bring them to the local NBC news station.But as Tom Lincoln goes upstairs, he quietly places a call to the Merrick Institute and demands the Biotech receptionist find someone who can explain to him why his insurance policy is in his house.As Tom Lincoln comes back downstairs, Jordan turns to Lincoln Six Echo, whispering to him with suspicion. She&#39;s read Tom Lincoln&#39;s eyes-= just like Lincoln Six Echo, Tom Lincoln&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t smile along with his mouth. She knows he lied to her. Lincoln Six Echo says that Jordan will stay behind in case nobody believes them.The two Lincolns get into one of Tom&#39;s fastest, fanciest cars. Lincoln Six Echo drives, much to Tom Lincoln&#39;s surprise. The half-million dollar Cadillac is activated by a thumbprint, and Lincoln Six Echo&#39;s is a perfect match. Tom Lincoln tells him that he cost five million dollars to have produced, which, as Tom Lincoln says, is a small price to cheat death.In the house, Jordan goes upstairs to Tom Lincoln&#39;s room and finds an open briefcase used to house two pistols. One of them is missing. She picks up the smaller one, weighing it in her hand.Lincoln must stop at a red light, and suddenly the light itself falls down just in front of the car-- Laurent&#39;s men have caught up with them in a Blackhawk helicopter. At that moment, Tom pulls his own pistol and tells Lincoln Six Echo that he&#39;s not ready to die for him. Saying that the feeling is mutual, Lincoln floors the gas pedal again, racing forward, throwing Tom off balance and leaving him unable to shoot, lest the car go careening out of control and crashing. When Tom Lincoln tries to wrestle for control, Lincoln Six Echo bites his hand and elbows him in the face.Laurent and his men follow in hot pursuit as Lincoln races down the highway, struggling to maintain control of the car while also fighting off Tom. Laurent&#39;s men corner the two in the interior of an abandoned museum. But as the two Lincolns emerge from the car, fighting for control of Tom Lincoln&#39;s gun, Laurent and his men freeze. Tom Lincoln&#39;s glasses have fallen off in the struggle, and there&#39;s no way to tell him apart from Lincoln Six Echo. The two Lincolns argue futilely back and forth, each claiming to be the real Tom Lincoln.But Lincoln Six Echo has a trump card. He realizes his Agnate bracelet, removed from his wrist by Tom, is in his pocket. In the confusion, he slips the bracelet out of his pocket and snaps it around Tom Lincoln&#39;s wrist. Laurent, suddenly spotting the bracelet, shoots Tom Lincoln to death. As Lincoln and Laurent leave, Laurent asks Lincoln where Jordan is. Lincoln says that she went out of state, to look for Sarah Jordan.As Laurent points out to Lincoln that he&#39;s been witness to certain &#39;trade secrets,&#39; Lincoln&#39;s answer subtly indicates that he&#39;s the clone. Laurent&#39;s tone hints that he&#39;s picked up on this, but is playing along. Lincoln says that people will do anything to survive, and he just wants to live, without regard for how.Laurent reports in to Dr. Merrick, who takes the news with extreme relief and happiness. Meanwhile, Lincoln returns to the house, and to Jordan. Jordan is initially suspicious, coming up from behind and pointing her gun at Lincoln. But as Lincoln turns around and says it&#39;s him, she sees the truth in his eyes. Jordan goes to Lincoln and starts kissing him, and the two make love. Jordan telle Lincoln that the Island is real after all: It&#39;s they, themselves. It&#39;s the spirit inside them.Dr. Merrick and the Incubation Chief are in the conditoining room for newly grown Agnates undergoing conditioning before integration into the Institute Agnate population. The entire batch of Echo, Foxtrot, Gamma, and Helo generation Agnates have shown similar neural pattern scans; inheriting memory imprints from their sponsors. The entire Agnate program has been predicated on predictability. But Lincoln Six Echo has shown that the universal trait of human curiosity has undermined it. The Institute is faced with a very large number of Agnates that have the trait for defiant behavior and the ability and nature to question Agnate life at the Institute. Dr. Merrick believes the only solution is a recall: the disposal of over 200 million dollars worth of product... the termination of almost half the Agnate population.Charlie Whitman calls Lincoln at his house to inform him of the recall. Lincoln, posing as his sponsor, Tom Lincoln, listens in horror as Whitman tells him that four generations of clones are going to be destroyed and re-grown. Whitman asks if Merrick reps can pick him up that afternoon to re-scan him so that his policy can be re-grown.Lincoln and Jordan know that they have to get away. Lincoln, believed to be the real Tom Lincoln, now has control of his sponsor&#39;s vast fortune. Once they finish building a full-scale Renovatio, they can ride south and find a new life together in anonymity. But first, they have to do something about the recall. All the other clones, who, to them, are very much real people, have to be saved. And the mechanism for the recall, as Dr. Merrick explains to wealthy investors, is already in place-- large numbers of Agnates will all be chosen simultaneously as &#34;Lottery winners&#34; to &#34;go to the Island.&#34; One such Lottery is shown, and Jones Three Echo is one of the ones chosen.Dr. Merrick requests a board vote on the termination of the infected products. The vote is unanimous in favor. Technicians and medical personnel are seen going to the Incubation room and prematurely extracting incubating Agnates from the incubation pods. Newly extracted Agnates going pre-integration conditioning are seen being administered lethal injections.Lincoln has a plan to save the living Agnates: He remembers the Holographic Control room. If he can shut it down, the Agnates at the Institute will all see the truth about the outside world; the holographic grids throughout the Institute hide it from them.Lincoln and Jordan put their plan into action. Lincoln studies all the photographs of Tom Lincoln and dresses himself up accordingly in Tom&#39;s clothes. He goes on the Merrick helicopter to be re-scanned. Jordan obtains a Ben and Jerry&#39;s Ice-cream stand and serves ice cream to young children. She then swipes McCord&#39;s credit card across the reader. Laurent&#39;s men pick up the scan immediately and mobilize. Jordan sits on a playground swing, calmly swinging on it. Laurent and his men converge, seizing her. Jordan properly plays along, acting frightened and crying as they bring her back to the Institute. Laurent looks thoughtfully at the thermal implant under the skin of Jordan&#39;s wrist as she anxiously runs her fingers across it.Whitman meets Lincoln in the client waiting room, and brings him to where he&#39;ll be scanned. Lincoln again plays along, acting indifferent and impatient to get the whole thing done and over with. Meanwhile, Jordan is brought to Surgery prep for organ harvest. Her kidneys, lungs, and heart are scheduled for transplant into her sponsor.In the data storage room, as Whitman turns his back and starts making idle small talk again, Lincoln suddenly clubs him unconscious with the butt of his gun. Meanwhile, as Jordan is on the gurney in the surgery prep room, she quietly eases her own gun out of her pants waistband-- Laurent and his men never having bothered to search her. She shoots the security agent in the leg, taking his walkie and the surgeon&#39;s tri-key, and dons a medical coat. Locking them in the surgery room, she uses hand-drawn sketches Lincoln made of the medical sector&#39;s layout, and traces her way to the entrance point, opening the door for Lincoln.As the two of them continue through the sector, they happen to pass by where a large group of Agnates are waiting for what they think is transport to the Island. Jordan gives Lincoln her tri-key and tells him he has to go on, to the holographic control grid. Lincoln goes into Sector Six while Jordan discreetly begins following the security escorts preparing to dispose of the Agnates.Laurent meets Dr. Merrick in his office. Merrick expresses his gratitude for Laurent&#39;s services and has Whitman write a check to pay him. Laurent asks about Sarah Jordan, and Dr. Merrick dismissively says that her prognosis isn&#39;t good-- even with the organ transplants, she&#39;s suffered enough brain damage that she probably won&#39;t recover. Despite this, the transplant is going through; the privilege she&#39;s paid for.Laurent tells Dr. Merrick that his father was part of a political rebellion in his native Burkina Faso. When the rebellion was crushed and Laurent&#39;s father slain, he and all his brothers were branded on their palms to show that, as children of a rebel, they were less than human. With all he&#39;s seen and done, he&#39;s learned that to many, war is a business. He asks Dr. Merrick when killing became a business for him.Dr. Merrick explains that to him, it&#39;s not about the killing. He doesn&#39;t see the Agnates as more than tools; medical instruments. He doesn&#39;t see them as having souls. Dr. Merrick gives life to stricken people, and in two years, predicts he&#39;ll be able to cure children&#39;s leukemia-- how many people can say that? Laurent quietly answers that only Dr. Merrick, and God, will be able to... and that this is exactly the way Dr. Merrick wants it.As Lincoln continues on his way to the power grid, Merrick biotech morgue workers are examining the body of Tom Lincoln to verify the cause of death for their records. The coroner suddenly notices that the Agnate bracelet is on the wrong wrist-- the right wrist (the hand Tom Lincoln held his gun in), while Agnates have their bracelets on their left wrist. The coroner immediately calls Dr. Merrick, who is horrified at the news that the real Tom Lincoln is the one who was killed.A full security alert is issued for Lincoln Six Echo, and Laurent hears the blaring of alarms. Lincoln has made it to the control room of the holographic power grid. When he shoots at the locked doors, security picks up the disturbance and notifies Dr. Merrick. Meanwhile, Jordan is following the &#39;chosen&#39; Agnates and their security escorts. As they go down a lift, Jordan turns and sees Laurent behind her. She aims her gun at him, but can&#39;t shoot. Laurent slowly approaches and deftly disarms her.The &#39;chosen&#39; Agnates are loaded into what looks roughly like a lift of some sort, but Jones Three Echo suspects something is wrong-- and he&#39;s right; he and the other Agnates have been placed into an incineration chamber. But as the security agent begins to activate it, Jordan and Laurent are there. Laurent is now working with Jordan to save all the Agnates at the Institute. They force the security personnel to shut down the incinerator and open it, releasing the Agnates inside.Lincoln has made his way to the reactor that controls the holographic power grid, and sees how to shut it down. As he pulls the lever to overload the reactor fan, he&#39;s attacked by Dr. Merrick. Merrick is amazed and impressed-- Lincoln Six Echo could have taken over his sponsor&#39;s life, but instead has come back. When he says, &#39;You truly are unique, Six Echo,&#39; Lincoln asserts, &#39;My name is Lincoln!&#39; and he fights back. Lincoln and Merrick grapple and struggle through the holographic reactor chamber. The reactor fan overloads and the reactor begins surging out of control. On a walkway in the control room, Dr. Merrick has control of Lincoln via a security issued harpoon/stun gun. Setting the gun down, he chooses to strangle Lincoln with his bare hands. Seeing the gun on the floor, Lincoln grabs it and fires the harpoon right through Merrick&#39;s throat, wrapping the cable around his neck. The turbine fans break loose from the reactor and spin wildly about the control room, destroying anything they collid with. The walkway on which Merrick and Lincoln struggle is broken apart, and Dr. Merrick is hanged by the harpoon cable. His body acting as a counterweight, Lincoln is able to climb to safety.The holographic grid is destroyed, All throughout the Agnate quarters, the Agnates see the holograms fade. They rush in frenzies, congregating around rays of natural sunlight shining through windows in the Institute buildings. The Agnates all begin to find their way out of the Institute and out of the bunker in which it&#39;s located, emerging into the outside world. Lincoln and Jordan find each other and begin kissing. They see Laurent behind them, and they and he look at each other with a mutual expression of gratitude.The Island closes with Jordan and Lincoln aboard a completed Renovatio as it cruises through crystal blue waters, taking them to a new life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |6.9   |2005-07-22  |tt0399201|

The sounds of children&#39;s voices die out, followed by a flash-forward to Los Angeles in 2029 AD. The world has become a wasteland of wrecked cars, destroyed buildings, and black-charred playgrounds filled with skeletons and skulls. The voice of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) narrates: &#34;3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day. They only lived to face a new nightmare: the war against the machines.&#34;The foot of a metallic android smashes a skull on the ground. A battle starts between human guerrilla troops and a technically far superior robotic army. Crushing skulls beneath their tracks, robotic tanks open a full-frontal assault on the humans, who are trained to make use of what shelter the ruined terrain offers them. Flying aircraft search the ground for targets as T-800 androids sweep the terrain at places the tanks cannot access. Although they suffer heavy losses, the humans manage to destroy several tanks, aircraft and androids. They even use old cars as crude assault vehicles, but the machines&#39; laser cannons are accurate and unrelenting.John Connor is saluted by his soldiers as he crosses a destroyed hallway and inspects the battlefield from a safe distance. The camera zooms in on his scarred face as Sarah&#39;s voice-over continues: &#34;Skynet, the computer that controlled the machines, sent two terminators back through time. Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human resistance: John Connor, my son. The first Terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year 1984, before John was born. It failed. The second was set to strike at John himself when he was just a child. As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior as a protector for John. It was just a question of which one would reach him first.&#34;The opening credits play in a montage of shots of playgrounds burning in an inferno. The credits end as the camera zooms in on the metal face of a Terminator, through the fire, until its red glowing eyes are in extreme close-up, accompanied by the thematic five rapid drumbeats.The action changes to a truck stop in the middle of the night. The wind scatters trash strewn around several trucks parked in the lot. Electric charges fill the air, jumping among several trucks. Out of nowhere, a brightly-lit orb appears, cutting out parts from the ground and a nearby truck. The orb dissolves, leaving a crouching, naked man in its place. As the electrical charges slowly fade, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rises to its feet. It has the same appearance as the one that got sent through time in The Terminator to kill Sarah Connor. We see its red point-of-view processing screen as it approaches the Corral, a biker bar across the street from the truck stop, inspects the motorcycles in front of it, and enters.The bikers inside watch with a mixture of astonishment and amusement as the naked Terminator calmly walks among them, inspecting every male customer on the way. It even attracts a couple of looks from one of the waitresses. It stops in front of a cigar-smoking biker as it determines that the man&#39;s clothes are a match to its body size. The Terminator calmly tells him that it needs his clothes, boots, and motorcycle, causing much hilarity among the other customers. The cigar man tells it that it forgot to say please and blows smoke in the Terminator&#39;s face. He puts out his cigar on Terminator&#39;s bare chest, only to be surprised that the pain doesn&#39;t seem to bother it. The Terminator grabs the man&#39;s hand and twists his arm. Another biker hits the Terminator in the head with a pool cue; he&#39;s hurled through the window for his trouble. The cigar biker is thrown into the kitchen and lands on the hot stove, burning his hands. A third tough biker pulls a knife on the Terminator. He stabs it, but is then disarmed and nailed to the pool table with his own knife. The rest of the customers scramble away. The Terminator enters the kitchen, approaching the wounded cigar biker. The frightened biker grabs a pistol and tries to shoot the Terminator, but it takes his pistol away from him. Terrified, he quickly tosses his keys to the Terminator.As George Thorogood&#39;s &#34;Bad to the Bone&#34; plays, the Terminator steps outside, fully dressed, and mounts one of the motorcycles, a large Harley-Davidson. Before it can ride off, the barkeeper comes out with a shotgun and fires a warning shot, threatening to kill it if it doesn&#39;t step off the bike. The Terminator gets off, calmly walks towards the man, and with a quick move, it relieves the barkeeper of his shotgun and sunglasses before riding off.In a different part of town, a police officer in a trash-strewn vacant lot underneath a bridge calls in a strange electrical disturbance to headquarters. As he inspects the area and notices a strange round hole burned into a chain link fence, he is approached from behind by a naked T-1000 (Robert Patrick), also a cyborg, less bulky than the Terminator. The T-1000 instantly kills the officer with a quick stab to the gut. Then the cyborg picks up the cop&#39;s gun, enters the police car fully clothed as a cop, and uses the car&#39;s computer to find the address of John Connor.The next day, John Connor&#39;s foster parents Todd (Xander Berkeley) and Janelle Voight (Jenette Goldstein) make several fruitless attempts to get John to clean up his room, but he ignores and ridicules them and leaves on his bike with his friend Tim (Danny Cooksey).In a cell at Pescadero State Hospital, a detention center for the criminally insane, Sarah Connor does chin-ups on her bed frame, which is standing on end. Psychiatrist Dr. Peter Silberman (Earl Boen) is showing some interns around, telling them about Sarah&#39;s acute schizo-affective disorder. It leads her to believe that a machine in human guise, called the Terminator, was sent back through time to kill her, and that the father of her child was a soldier from the future, sent back to protect her. Silberman greets her good morning, to which Sarah pseudo-politely asks about his knee, which she stabbed with a pen some weeks before. Silberman has the interns take a look at her like she is a caged animal, and then asks two orderlies to make sure that Sarah tidies her room and takes her medicine. The orderlies enter the cell, but Sarah refuses the medication. They tell her to be good because she is on review that afternoon, but when she still refuses, they smack her in the gut with a baton, kick her around and zap her with a taser before they force the medication down her throat and leave her..The T-1000 arrives at the home of John Connor foster parents and ask about John. They tell him John took off on his bike. It asks for John&#39;s picture, saying it only needs to ask John some questions. Todd mentions that a big guy on a bike (the Terminator) was asking about John that morning as well, but despite its suspicious glance, the T-1000 assures them not to worry.John breaks into an ATM using a pin code decoder. Tim finds a picture of Sarah in John&#39;s bag (it&#39;s the picture that was taken of Sarah at the end of the previous movie and was later given to Kyle Reese). John comments that Sarah is a complete psycho, because she got arrested for trying to blow up a computer factory. They take off for the mall to spend the money they&#39;ve stolen, missing the searching Terminator by a few blocks.Sarah is in a deep sleep from the medication when she is woken by a familiar voice. It is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), the man who died protecting her from the first Terminator. He tells her that John is in danger and that she needs to protect him, to which she replies that he doesn&#39;t believe her anymore. Reese talks some strength back into her and repeats his earlier message: the future is not set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves. She hugs him, but when she opens her eyes, Reese is standing in the cell door opening, saying that there is not much time left in the world. He walks away, and Sarah follows him out of the hospital. She finds herself on a sunny grass field behind a fence. On the other side are children playing in a playground. She tries to warn them away, but no sound comes from her mouth. There is a sudden bright flash and she wakes up next to her bed in her cell.During the psychological review later that day, Sarah watches a video from one of her earlier evaluations, where she described her dream of the world and its children burning in a nuclear nightmare. She went into a fit of rage because no one seemed to believe her prediction. Silberman stops the video, and Sarah tells him that she is feeling much better now; she no longer believes in the existence of Terminators, and recants her claim that the factory where she crushed one covered the whole thing up.Meanwhile, in a computer lab somewhere, computer developer Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) is asked permission to conduct a test with a certain device that is only referred to as &#39;it.&#39; When one of his co-workers asks where &#39;it&#39; came from, he gives him the same answer he received from his superiors: &#34;Don&#39;t ask.&#34; Dyson goes into the vault, where he observes a fragment of a computer chip and a metal robot arm that was clearly once attached to a Terminator.Sarah asks Dr. Silberman to transfer her to a minimum security ward, but he believes that she is faking her recovery, and thinks she will only use this transfer for another escape attempt. When he also refuses to let her see her son, she attacks him before being restrained and drugged by orderlies.John is driving with Tim through an abandoned canal when the Terminator passes overhead, identifies him and lays in a pursuit. Meanwhile, the T-1000, dressed as a cop, shows John&#39;s picture to a couple of girls; they direct it to the Galleria. The Terminator arrives at the Galleria and identifies John&#39;s bike. While John is inside playing arcade games, both the T-1000 and the Terminator (carrying a long box full of roses) are searching for him. The T-1000 is directed to the game hall, where it bumps into Tim, who is getting some more quarters. It shows Tim John&#39;s picture. Tim pretends he doesn&#39;t know the person in the picture, but quickly walks back to John and warns him about the T-1000.John runs out the back of the arcade into the mall service hallway to escape from the T-1000. He eventually finds himself in a hallway, caught in between the Terminator and the T-1000. As the two cyborgs advance, the T-1000 draws its service pistol and the Terminator produces a shotgun from a longbox full of roses. Entering the hallway, the Terminator shoots the T-1000 in the shoulder and deflects its aim. The T-1000 quickly recovers and empties an entire clip at John, killing a janitor caught in the crossfire, while the Terminator puts itself in front of John, shielding him from the bullets. While the T-1000 reloads, the Terminator breaks a door, pushes John to safety, and marches towards the T-1000, shooting it repeatedly with its shotgun. It isn&#39;t until the Terminator fires its last round the T-1000 finally falls on its back.As the Terminator reloads its shotgun, the large metallic holes its bullets made in the T-1000&#39;s chest suddenly heal themselves. It gets up and there is a short struggle between the two cyborgs for the gun. In the fight, they force each other into the wall several times, until one wall finally gives, and they tumble into a clothing store. The T-1000 is quicker on its feet, throws the Terminator out through the shop-window, and gets back to chasing John. Shoppers are amazed to see the Terminator get back on its feet so quickly (one of them manages to take some pictures), grabbing its shotgun and following John and the T-1000.In the meantime, John has reached his motorcycle, but has problems getting it to start. As the T-1000 enters the garage and dashes towards him, John gets the bike to work and drives away, barely shaking off his assailant as he makes it to the street. The T-1000 hitches an involuntary ride from a passing truck by throwing its driver out and pursues John with little regard for other motorists. It, in turn, is chased by the Terminator on its Harley.John makes it to an old drainage canal, apparently to safety, but the T-1000&#39;s truck suddenly comes up from a bridge, crashes through the railing, and dives into the canal. John drives off, and although the canal is a hard place to maneuver a truck, the T-1000 gains on John. Meanwhile, the Terminator drives along the edge of the canal, firing some shots at the truck, which is nearing a bridge spanning the canal. The bridge rips the roof off the truck&#39;s cabin but the T-1000 has ducked away and maintains control of the vehicle. It tries to overrun John as the Terminator reaches a dead end in the elevation and is forced to jump down with its bike into the canal. It manages to pass the truck and drive alongside John, picks him up from his bike, puts him in front of itself, and puts a bullet in the truck&#39;s tire. The truck crashes into another column in the canal and a spark in some loose wiring causes it to explode. The Terminator stops the bike and points its gun at the blazing fire, but only a burning tire rolls out. He drives away with John, but seconds later, the T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop. When emergency workers arrive, the T-1000 escapes by stealing a police car.As they ride off, John asks the Terminator to pull over. His rescuer confirms it is a Terminator, a Cyberdyne Systems model 101: a cybernetic organism, made of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. John checks the bullet holes in the Terminator&#39;s back, but still has a hard time buying it. He already realizes that the Terminator has not come to kill him, but to protect him. The Terminator explains that it was re-programmed and sent back 35 years from the future, by John himself, to be his protector in the current time.It&#39;s evening, and while driving the bike, the Terminator explains that the other guy is a T-1000: an advanced prototype made of a &#34;mimetic polyalloy,&#34; or liquid metal. It says they have to get out of the city and avoid the authorities. John wants to stop at his house, but Terminator assures him that the T-1000 will try to reacquire him there, as the Terminator itself would try.The Terminator and John stop by a pay phone because John insists on calling his foster parents to warn them. Janelle answers, and expresses her concern for John. John is confused, as she is never this nice. He can hear Todd through the phone yelling at the dog for barking continuously, but he is suddenly silenced. John worries that the T-1000 might be there already. The Terminator asks John for the dog&#39;s name; its Max. It takes the phone and asks Janelle, with John&#39;s voice, what is wrong with &#39;Wolfy&#39;. Janelle says Wolfy is fine. The Terminator hangs up and tells John his foster parents are dead. On cue, the camera pulls back to reveal that &#34;Janelle&#34; is actually the T-1000 mimicking her. Its arm has formed into a silver blade, which has skewered Todd&#39;s head. It retracts the blade, letting Todd&#39;s lifeless body fall to the ground, and it slowly reforms the blade into its arm. The T-1000 then resumes its cop form. As it leaves the house, the T-1000 walks toward Max the dog, who is barking loudly. It kills the dog with a quick stab, and rips off its collar; it reads &#39;Max&#39;. It knows it has been fooled. The Terminator explains to John that the T-1000 can imitate anything of equal size that it has sampled previously by physical contact. It can&#39;t become a bomb or a complex structure with chemicals or moving parts (such as a gun), but it can form knives and stabbing weapons.At Pescadero Hospital, a police detective shows Sarah Connor some pictures from the West Highland police station, taken by a video surveillance camera in 1984. They show the first Terminator on a killing spree inside the station. The detective explains that the unknown man killed 17 police officers with families and children that night. His colleague shows her pictures taken at the mall that day by a tourist: they show the same man. The officers tell her John is missing and that his foster parents were murdered, and ask her about the guy in the picture, but she doesn&#39;t give the slightest response. Dr. Silberman tells them she is fading out of reality, and lets them out. Sarah surreptitiously takes a paperclip from the desk before one of the wardens takes her back to her cell.John tells the Terminator about his time in Nicaragua, where Sarah hooked up with several guys to gather weapons and teach John to become a great military leader. John now realizes that she was right all the time, and he wants to rescue her. The Terminator refuses, stating that the T-1000 will most likely copy Sarah and wait for John to come to her. When John hears that the subject being copied is typically terminated, he insists on saving her immediately. Terminator restrains him, saying Sarah is not a mission priority. John objects and calls out for help, but when he orders it to let go, the android complies. To his joy, John finds out that obeying John is one of the Terminator&#39;s mission parameters. John tests it by ordering it to stand on one foot: it complies. Two guys are responding to John&#39;s cry for help. They get into an argument, and John has Terminator grab one of the guys by his hair. When the other guy attacks, Terminator breaks his hand and tries to shoot him; John prevents this from happening and sends the guys away. He tries to explain to Terminator why he can&#39;t just kill people, but the robot doesn&#39;t understand. John tries to convince it that unnecessary killing is something it just can&#39;t do, orders it to help him save his mother, and they ride on.In the meantime, the T-1000 arrives at Pescadero and is given access by one of the guards. Sarah is restrained to her bed by Douglas (Ken Gibbel), one of the other guards. He humiliates her further, locks her cell and bangs his baton against several cell doors as he leaves. Sarah spits out the paperclip she stole and uses it to pick the locks of her restraints and the door lock. The T-1000 comes up at a desk and asks the nurse for Sarah Connor. She tells him that other cops have already been with her for an hour, as she sees them coming out. When she looks back at the T-1000, she notices that he has gone; he is nowhere in the hallway. She lets Lewis (Don Stanton), one of the guards, through the security door; he shows the police officers out before he walks over to a coffee machine. But as he steps on the checkered hallway floor, the T-1000, mimicking the floor, stands up, and slowly copies the shape and image of Lewis, who is unaware of his counterpart forming behind him. When he turns around, he is astounded to be facing a copy of himself (Don Stanton&#39;s identical twin brother Dan Stanton). Before Lewis can react, the T-1000 skewers him through his eye by extruding its finger into an ice pick-like extension, then drags his body into a cleaning room. It makes its way to the maximum security wing.Meanwhile, Douglas finds that one of the maintenance rooms has been opened, and that a broom handle has been broken off. As he exits the room, he is punched to pulp by Sarah with the broom handle, dragged and locked into her room. She takes his keys and baton and leaves. She hides from Lewis (actually the T-1000) who is walking in one of the adjacent wings. The T-1000 reverts to its cop form as Sarah sneaks up to Silberman and an orderly. She beats the orderly unconscious and breaks Dr. Silberman&#39;s arm. She drugs the orderly with a tranquillizer and fills the empty syringe with sink cleaning fluid.John and the Terminator arrive at Pescadero, and John makes it swear that it will not kill anyone. When the guard cites the visiting hours, Terminator shoots him in the legs, reassuring John that the man will survive. They park the motorcycle in the garage. Sarah arrives with Silberman as her hostage at the security office. She has the poison-filled syringe in his neck, and reassures him that she has no problems killing him, since she already believes him dead. He orders the guards to open the door. She gets through but doesn&#39;t notice another guard behind her. He saves Silberman from her hands, but gets punched to the floor. Sarah makes a run for it. The guards sound the alarm, which also attracts the attention of the T-1000, which just discovered the drugged guard. Sarah manages to lock out the chasing wardens by breaking off a key, so they have to find an alternate route.Sarah makes it to the elevators, but to her horror, an old acquaintance walks out: the Terminator, her tormentor from the past. With a yell of fear and disbelief, she runs back the other way. Sarah is so blinded by panic that she doesn&#39;t notice John&#39;s calls. The wardens who have found another access route work her to the floor and try to subdue her.John asks the Terminator to help his mother. It walks over to the wardens, who have a hard time restraining Sarah who is frantically yelling &#34;He&#39;ll kill us all!&#34; Dr Silberman tries to give Sarah a tranquillizer shot, but the Terminator grabs the wardens around him one by one (except for Silberman), and smashes them against the windows and walls, knocking them out but not killing them. John crouches down by Sarah, who is looking at him and the Terminator in utter disbelief. John assures her that the Terminator is here to help, and she grabs its hand.At that time, the T-1000 appears at the end of the hallway, blocked by a set of bars. It walks through them with ease, its liquid metal pouring through the bars like pudding (except for its pistol). John and Sarah run to the elevator as the Terminator fires several shots at the T-1000, which slow it down. The T-1000 runs past a stunned Silberman, firing, but the Terminator serves as a shield again until the elevator doors close behind him. The T-1000 uses its knife-arms to pry the door open, but the Terminator quickly fires a point-blank shot, splitting the other cyborg&#39;s head apart.The elevator descends as the T-1000 fuses its head back together. It pries the doors open again and jumps on the roof of the elevator, stabbing its knives through the roof hoping to hit one of its targets. The Terminator and Sarah fire several shots back through the ceiling before Sarah&#39;s shoulder is cut by one of T-1000&#39;s lucky stabs. The elevator arrives at the garage and they all exit. Sarah commandeers a police car that is just arriving. The T-1000 has perforated the roof enough to pour itself through a small hole as an amorphous blob of metal. It quickly reshapes into human form, opens the elevator door and gives chase, so the Terminator is forced to drive away in reverse. They fire several clips and shells at it, but it keeps gaining. After exiting the garage, the Terminator spins the car 180 degrees, but this momentary slow-down allows T-1000 to jump and haul itself onto the trunk with its arm-hooks. It smashes the back window and slices at John, but the Terminator manages to shoot it off the moving car. It gets back on its feet, but stops its pursuit as it realizes it cannot keep up with the car on foot. John pulls the severed hook from the car&#39;s trunk, and throws it on the street. The T-1000 walks towards it, merges the hook back into its foot, and walks back to Pescadero.John, Sarah, and the Terminator drive away at high speed, safe from the deadly T-1000, at least for now. Sarah opens her arms to John, apparently to give him a big hug, but she only wants to check him for wounds or bruises. Sarah reprimands him for risking his life trying to save her; he is too important for that. John is baffled by Sarah&#39;s cold reaction, saying that he just needed to get her out of there, but she bluntly responds that she can take care of herself. Terminator asks John about the tears in his eyes, but he says it&#39;s nothing.The T-1000 returns on foot to Pescadero, where the police have arrived. A cop on a motorcycle asks if it is okay. It affirms, and compliments the cop on his nice motorcycle.The three fugitives arrive at an abandoned gas station and hide the car in the garage. The Terminator tends to Sarah&#39;s shoulder wound, saying that it knows what it is doing because it has detailed files on human anatomy. Sarah remarks that this makes it a more efficient killer; the Terminator confirms the notion. Sarah in turn removes the bullets from the Terminator&#39;s back. John asks is it feels any pain, to which the Terminator replies that it senses injuries, which could be regarded as pain. It explains that its wounds will heal, which is good according to Sarah, because the Terminator won&#39;t be of much use if it can&#39;t pass for human. The Terminator tells John that it will last 120 years with its existing power cell; that its CPU (central processing unit) is a learning computer and that it can learn more about being human as it has more contact with humans.Alternative scene: Terminator explains to John that its CPU is a learning computer, but Skynet disables the learning ability when Terminators are sent out alone. When John suggests that they can reset the switch, he and Sarah operate on the Terminator. She removes part of its scalp, opens its metal skull, and removes the chip inside, shutting down the android completely. However, to John&#39;s horror, she wants to destroy the chip, because she doesn&#39;t trust John&#39;s new friend. She wants to use this opportunity to disable it, but John convinces her that they need it, and that if he is to be a great military leader, she should start listening to some of his ideas for a change. Reluctantly, she concedes, and they reinsert the chip.The Terminator keeps watch all night, and at dawn, he hot-wires another vehicle. John teaches him that some cars have the keys tucked behind the sun visor. To get away from the city as fast as possible, they drive through the desert to one of Sarah&#39;s hideout places. John notices that the Terminator always uses words like &#34;affirmative;&#34; he teaches it to use more colloquial expressions such as &#34;no problemo,&#34; &#34;eat me,&#34; &#34;hasta la vista, baby,&#34; and &#34;chill out, dickwad.&#34; They stop at a gas station for some food. John sees how serious his mother is all the time, and he tells the Terminator that it could smile once in a while too. To give an example, John unsuccessfully attempts to make one of the restaurant attendants smile, then points at a guy at a phone booth smiling. The Terminator tries to imitate him, but the result is less than convincing, so John advises it to practice in front of a mirror first.John sees some children playing with toy guns. He ponders that humans as a species probably won&#39;t make it; the Terminator comments that it is in their nature to destroy themselves. Sarah inquires about who is responsible for building Skynet. As they start driving again, the Terminator tells her that it is Miles Bennett Dyson, a high- ranking employee at Cyberdyne Systems, who will invent a new microprocessor that will revolutionize the entire landscape of military computing. Cyberdyne computers will completely replace human functions and decisions in strategic defense systems as the Skynet program goes on-line on August 4th, 1997. It learns at such a fast rate that it becomes self-aware on August 29th. As the humans try to shut it down, Skynet starts a nuclear strike that plunges Earth&#39;s nations into a nuclear war, in which the humans destroy each other. Sarah asks for detailed files about Dyson.At the Dyson residence, Miles is frantically working at his computer, though he promised his wife Tarissa (S. Epatha Merkerson) to take the children out swimming. Miles tries to explain to her that his work on the new microprocessor is very important and that he is very close to completing it. Tarissa jokingly wonders why they started a family anyway, since he seems more concerned with his project. Miles surrenders and takes the kids out to play.Sarah, John and the Terminator arrive at a farm in the desert that seems abandoned. However, her friend Enrique Salceda (Castulo Guerra, being very suspicious of unannounced visitors, comes out of hiding at the sound of her voice. He welcomes Sarah, John, and the Terminator (who John introduces as Uncle Bob) and tells them that they are all over the news as wanted persons. Enrique is not too thrilled to hear that Sarah has come to collect most of his stuff -- clothes, food and a truck -- and she orders John and the Terminator to gather weapons. The Terminator opens a secret stash filled with lots of weapons and ammunition. Sarah notifies Enrique about her plans to cross the border after nightfall, and tells him to leave the range as well, since it is dangerous for him too. He expected that Sarah would bring trouble, but he seems to be used to it. While working in the weapons stash, John tells how he grew up learning about weapons and explosives, and how he had a hard time adjusting to a normal life after Sarah got arrested. He learns from the Terminator that it has no fear of death, nor feels any other emotion about it; it just has to stay functional until its mission is complete. John thinks about himself the same way, although he is not too keen about the important role he has yet to play. The Terminator uncovers a minigun, which makes even the android smile.While helping the Terminator repair a truck, John wonders about his real father, who he will meet when he is in his forties, but who hasn&#39;t even been born yet. John thinks Sarah still cries about him sometimes. Terminator asks him why people cry. John says it happens when people are hurt, although not physically. The machine doesn&#39;t understand. When the truck works again, John teaches Terminator how to do a high five, as Sarah watches them from a distance. She narrates: &#34;Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop, never leave him, never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there, and it would die to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this machine was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.&#34;Sarah carves at a wooden table with her knife and watches Enrique playing happily with his family. She falls asleep, and finds herself in a green pasture, behind a fence. On the other side, children are playing in a playground. She tries to warn them away, but no sound comes from her mouth. She sees a younger, innocent version of herself among the people: dressed in her old waitress uniform, playing with infant John, also seemingly aware that something is wrong. As Sarah pounds the fence in frustration, a blinding white flash illuminates the area. People scream in terror as the bright light dies down, revealing a huge nuclear cloud column at the horizon. In an instant, temperatures rise to extremes, causing Sarah, everyone and everything to spontaneously burst into flames. A panoramic shot shows a nuclear shock wave propagating through downtown LA, turning every building in its path into instant rubble. Cars, buses, buildings, and trees are singed and blown to pieces, and as the fire reaches the burnt people, their ashes spread like black dust in the wind. As the fire burns Sarah&#39;s flesh away, leaving only her skeleton hanging by the fence, she wakes up with a shock, realizing it was a dream. She looks at the words she just carved into the table: NO FATE; she knows that she can only stop her dream from becoming reality if she acts now.Sarah sticks the knife into the table, gathers an M16 rifle and her gear, and gets into the car. John sees it, and hears from Enrique that he and the Terminator are supposed to proceed towards the south, where Sarah will meet up with them tomorrow. John runs towards Sarah, but she drives off quickly without a word or looking back. John reads the words on the table: NO FATE. John explains to the Terminator that it was a message from his future self to Sarah, passed on by his father Kyle: The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. When the Terminator guesses that Sarah intends to change the future, John suddenly realizes that she is going after Miles Dyson. They take off after her in the repaired truck.As Sarah races ahead, the Terminator warns John that the T-1000 has the same data and might be waiting for them at Dyson&#39;s house, but John is intent on stopping Sarah. The Terminator suggests that Dyson&#39;s death might actually prevent the war from happening, but John does not want to hear about it. He angrily blames Terminator for still not understanding the value of human life, and insists that it try to learn.At the Dyson residence, Sarah sets up her silenced gun behind the swimming pool, where she can see Miles working at his computer, unaware of the danger outside. Dyson&#39;s son Danny (DeVaughn Nixon) is playing in the house with his remote-controlled car, waving off his mother&#39;s orders to go to bed like his sister. Outside, Sarah loads the rifle and takes aim, pointing a red laser at the back of Miles&#39;s head. At the moment of firing, Danny drives the remote car against Miles&#39; foot, making him quickly bend over to pick it up. The bullet misses him and hits the computer screen. As Miles realizes the shot came through the window, Sarah fires again but misses. Miles takes cover behind his desk, so Sarah rakes the house with rapid fire. Miles warns away his wife and son as Sarah reloads and empties another clip into the room. She takes a handgun and walks to the house. Miles sees her and makes a run for his living room. Sarah fires several shots at him, and the third one hits Miles in the shoulder. He collapses to the floor as his wife and son get to him. Sarah tries to force them away at gunpoint, but the young boy stays, pleading for his father&#39;s life. Miles pushes the boy away to his mother, asking Sarah to let the boy go, but her eyes are wild with rage. She raves at the bewildered man that everything is his fault and that she will not let him do it. Miles starts to cry uncontrollably, and Sarah realizes what she is about to do; she does not pull the trigger. She backs away and sinks to the floor, crying.John and the Terminator enter the ravaged house, fearing that they are too late. John takes care of his mother and tells the Terminator to check on Miles Dyson. Sarah is traumatized, realizing that she nearly killed a man, and John hugs her, assuring her that they will find a way. Finally she is able to tell him she loves him, and he returns her affection. The Terminator diagnoses Miles&#39;s injury as a flesh wound and instructs Tarissa to stop the bleeding by putting pressure on the wound. Miles asks John and the Terminator who they are. John gives the Terminator a knife, tells it to show Miles what it is, and takes Danny away to his room. With gasps and cries of horror and disbelief, Miles and Tarissa watch the Terminator make large cuts in its arm, and remove the skin to reveal a sophisticatedly crafted, bloody metal arm and hand, the same kind Miles saw on display at Cyberdyne. The Terminator requests that Miles and Tarissa listen carefully.Sarah narrates: &#34;Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down. Skynet, Judgment Day, the history of things to come. Its not every day that you find out you are responsible for 3 billion deaths. He took it pretty well.&#34; Miles is taken aback by the story, but tries to defend himself against accusations for things he has not even done yet by asking how he was supposed to know. Sarah sneers that this is the excuse of all men, thinking they are great and creative, while inventing nothing but death and destruction. John cuts off the discussion as it won&#39;t get them anywhere. Miles tells them he will stop working on the processor and quit his job at Cyberdyne, but Sarah and the Terminator convince him that nobody must be allowed to finish his work; the lab and all relevant files in his home must be destroyed also. Miles tells them about the chip at Cyberdyne, which came from the first Terminator, although he was not informed about its origin at the time; this confirms all of Sarah&#39;s suspicions about the factory covering up the whole incident with her and the first Terminator. The chip was broken, but it gave Miles the inspiration for his revolutionary new chip design. Miles offers to help them pass Cyberdyne&#39;s security to completely destroy the remnant chip and all traces of his work.While driving to Cyberdyne, Sarah narrates: &#34;The future, always so clear to me, had become like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now, making up history as we went along.&#34; The group arrives at the Cyberdyne lab headquarters, packed with large bags full of equipment. Miles gets them through the main entrance to the security desk, and tries to convince the guard that they are friends who he wants to show around. As the guard berates him for bringing visitors without special authorization, they draw their weapons and restrain him. They use an elevator to move to the second floor, where Miles explains how they need his key and another one in the security station to open the vault holding the chip and Terminator arm.Meanwhile, another guard returns to the front desk and grumbles at his partner for leaving the desk unattended, only to find the man tied up and gagged inside the toilet. Miles and Sarah enter the security station as the guard triggers the silent alarm. Miles&#39;s access card no longer opens the key locker; the alarm has neutralized all codes inside the building. He wants to abort, but Sarah convinces him they have to go all the way. John assures them that he can open the safe and gets his pin code decoder out. The two guards downstairs have identified Sarah and the Terminator as the two wanted criminals from the news; they call the police and ask for all police units in the area. Miles&#39;s entry code won&#39;t open the door to the lab, so the Terminator suggests using his, which means blowing through the door with a grenade launcher. This sets off the Halon fire extinguishing system, which displaces all oxygen to put out the fire. Sarah and Miles wait to enter the lab until the Halon dissipates, but the Terminator walks through the lab and retrieves two breathing masks for them. They enter the lab and get to work.The T-1000 arrives at the Dyson residence appearing as a motorcycle cop, wearing a helmet and reflective sun glasses. He finds the house deserted, all of the computers destroyed, and a garbage can full of burning paper. His police radio broadcasts a call for all units to respond to Cyberdyne Systems, and describes the suspects: Sarah Connor, escaped from Pescadero State Hospital the night before; and a white male, the possible killer from the West Highland Police Station massacre in 1984.The Terminator chops up several computers and servers with a fire axe. Miles directs Sarah to all the disks and processors containing important data that must be destroyed. Sarah tells him they will blow it all up. Then Miles sees the enlarged model of his new chip design. He asks the Terminator for the axe, says he worked a lot of years on the model, then smashes it apart with a violent strike of the axe.A large police force arrives at Cyberdyne, surrounding the building while a police helicopter hovers outside, shining its spotlight inside a deserted office area. John opens the key locker and retrieves the vault key. As he leaves, he narrowly avoids being spotted by the helicopter. A quick glimpse on a monitor shows him the entire police force barricaded outside. Sarah and the Terminator place barrels of explosive liquids and detonation packs. The Terminator gives Miles a remote control, showing him how they are going to set off the explosions. John enters the lab with the key, telling the others they have company -- all of the police have arrived. Sarah says she will finish up and orders them to go ahead. The Terminator says it will take care of the police; John reminds him of his promises, but the Terminator reassures him with a simple &#34;Trust me.&#34;The android walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. It ignores the police&#39;s order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. The minigun empty, Terminator uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. Terminator turns back into the building and the police open fire with Heckler &amp; Koch HK94A3 submachine guns. John and Miles reach the vault and open it. John breaks the glass cases containing the chip fragment and metal arm. He gloats that they&#39;ve got &#34;Skynet by the balls.&#34;A heavily armed SWAT team enters the building and climbs the stairs to the second floor as Sarah and the other three prepare to leave. She gives John the gas masks and he and the Terminator leave the room. As Sarah asks Miles for the detonator, the SWAT team bursts into the lab, opening fire. Sarah takes cover behind a desk, but Miles is hit several times, and sinks to the floor. John tries to get to his mom, but the Terminator prevents him from endangering himself. Sarah looks at the mortally injured Miles, who holds the detonator in his hand. With a silent expression, he assures her that he will take care of it. Sarah waits for the SWAT members to reload, fires several shots from her sidearm into the air, and then makes a run for the back of the lab. Glass windows around her break as the SWAT team opens fire on her, and she barely rolls herself to cover in the room where the vault is. John is following her escape on a monitor and tells the Terminator there is no other exit for her there. With a loud thud, it breaks through the wall and pulls Sarah in through the hole. It breaks a steel door with another blast of its grenade launcher, and the three make their way through a safe corridor to the elevator.The SWAT team advances through the lab towards Miles, who is holding a piece of his chip model above a detonator switch. With heavy dying breaths, he tells the SWAT leader that he doesn&#39;t know how much longer he can hold it up. Realizing the imminent danger, the SWAT leader (Dean Norris) orders his team to pull back immediately. As John, Sarah and the Terminator get into the elevator, Miles&#39; rate of breathing becomes slower and slower. Finally, it stops, and he drops the part onto the trigger. An enormous explosion erupts from the building, destroying the entire lab.The elevator comes to an abrupt halt on the first floor. The T-1000 arrives on its motorcycle between the burnt-out car wrecks in front of the Cyberdyne building. The elevator doors open and the Terminator checks the lobby, which is full of the SWAT team members. They fire tear gas grenades to the elevator, which forces John and Sarah to buddy-breathe with the only remaining gas mask. Terminator tells them to stay there; it will be back. It advances towards the SWAT team, ignoring their leader&#39;s orders to lie down on the floor. They open fire, the bullets ripping pieces of flesh from its metal body, but they cannot stop its advance. As it closes in on them, it uses its sidearm to shoot the men in the legs; it uses the gas grenade launcher to disable the remaining two members. The T-1000 drives its motorcycle up one of the staircases of the blown-out building. The Terminator exits through the main entrance and fires the remaining gas grenades at the police, disabling the entire force. It relieves two remaining SWAT members of their van (remembering to look for the keys behind the sun visor), drives it through the main entrance and picks up John and Sarah. It takes off at high speed as several police officers fire shots at the van. As the T-1000 drives through the destroyed lab, it hears the gunshots and sees the SWAT van leaving in the distance. When it notices the helicopter flying near the building, it accelerates, jumps its motorcycle out of the building, and grabs hold of the helicopter as the bike crashes to the ground. The dumb-struck pilot watches the T-1000 break the canopy with its head, pour into the cockpit in its amorphous chrome form and instantly resume its previous appearance. It tells the pilot to get out and he jumps. Now in control of the helicopter, the T-1000 pursues the van.In the back of the van, Sarah buries John under a pile of bullet-proof vests, telling him to stay under them no matter what happens. She also covers the van&#39;s back windows with vests, as she notices the helicopter closing in; the Terminator tells her it is the T-1000. Sarah and the T-1000 exchange automatic weapon fire as the Terminator navigates the highway, narrowly missing several cars. It drives under a bridge, but the helicopter simply follows. They pass a large semi, which forces the T-1000 to fly over another bridge. It quickly gains on the van and manages to shoot Sarah in the leg. The Terminator abruptly stops, causing the helicopter to collide with the back of the van; it crumbles and crashes violently onto the road. The crash causes one of the van&#39;s tires to rip, and the van topples over on the road. The driver of the large truck has come to a halt at the crashed helicopter, as the driver of a pick-up truck comes to check on the tipped-over van. The large truck&#39;s driver is amazed to see the T-1000 appearing unharmed from the wrecked helicopter, but the T-1000 simply skewers him with his blade-hand and mounts the truck. The Terminator, John and Sarah stumble from the SWAT van; the pick-up truck driver backs away from the Terminator&#39;s large facial wounds, as it sees the large truck emerging from the smoke several hundred yards back; it reads LIQUID NITROGEN on the side. The three commandeer the pick-up truck as the T-1000&#39;s truck rams a stopped car out of the way in the distance. The Terminator drives away as the T-1000 smashes the remains of the SWAT van; the pick-up driver barely gets out of the way.John uses a T-shirt from the truck to slow the bleeding from Sarah&#39;s leg. The Terminator tries to stay ahead of the liquid nitrogen truck, but 60 mph is the pick-up truck&#39;s top speed. As Sarah binds her leg and howls in pain, the large truck rams the back of the pick-up. The T-1000 tries to crush the pick-up against the side-rail, but another truck coming up ahead forces it to move away. The Terminator tells John to take the wheel and fires a grenade at the large truck, which takes it slightly off course. The Terminator directs John to take the off ramp, but the T-1000 follows. John narrowly misses another truck as the Terminator fires another grenade. It hits the truck on the side; the truck rams into the pick-up from behind again, causing the Terminator to drop a grenade shell. John drives the truck through the gates of a steel mill, closely followed by the T-1000. The Terminator grabs its M16 rifle and climbs onto the hood of the T-1000&#39;s truck, where it empties the entire clip into the liquid android. Then it turns the wheel quickly to the left, causing the liquid nitrogen truck to topple over and slide behind John and Sarah. The Terminator holds on to the still moving, tipped-over truck as John drives through a hangar-sized steel foundry full of workers.The pick-up truck comes to an abrupt halt when it impales itself on a parked lift-truck, one lifter passing between John and his mother. As the sliding liquid nitrogen truck comes screeching into the hangar and crashes against one side of the entrance, the Terminator jumps off, rolls himself to safety and comes to a stop against a couple of pipes. The enormous momentum causes the truck to split open in the middle and liquid nitrogen pours from the rupture. As the evaporating nitrogen invades the work area, one of the workers sounds the alarm and all workers instantly evacuate. John, Sarah, and the Terminator watch the T-1000 clambering out of the truck cabin under a pouring rain of liquid nitrogen. As the android appears from the cloud of vapor, it seems to be moving much more sluggishly than usual. A layer of frost covers the creaking T-1000 as it attempts to walk, but its frozen feet keep sticking to the floor. Its continuous efforts to walk cause the legs to break off at the ankle and knees. Trying to break its fall with its hand, the T-1000 finds the hand frozen to the floor as well. With a violent pull, it breaks free, snapping off its arm to its own astonishment. A few creaking tweaks and turns follow, and it remains motionless. Terminator picks itself up from the floor, points its gun and shoots the frozen android into hundreds of small pieces, saying &#34;Hasta la vista, baby.&#34;John gets out of the truck to watch his broken enemy. However, one of the pools of molten metal in the hangar has begun to overflow, and the heat starts to thaw the frozen pieces of the T-1000. The metal becomes liquid again, and the drops start to coalesce into one big blob. The Terminator says there is not much time any more, and John helps Sarah get up; the liquid metal blob is already shaping into the familiar human form again. The Terminator reloads its grenade launcher with the shell it dropped earlier and helps John move Sarah. The T-1000 regains its cop form. It follows John, Sarah, and the Terminator on foot as they head deeper into the steel mill.While holding a yellow-and-black striped bar, the T-1000 finds that it has been damaged: its arm has mimicked the striped pattern of the bar. It pulls the hand loose from the bar, changes it back to normal with a flick and starts following its targets again. The Terminator leads John and Sarah through the maze of equipment and machinery in the steel mill. As the T-1000 closes in, there is a glitch going over its surface. Apparently, it has difficulty keeping its current form; its feet keep taking on the color and texture of the metal floor.John, Sarah, and the Terminator come up at the edge of a molten metal pool, but Sarah can&#39;t stand the heat. They return, but see the T-1000 approaching a few yards ahead. The Terminator sends John and Sarah on their way, despite John&#39;s desire to stick together. Sarah drags John away while the Terminator readies its gun and grenade launcher. Its internal processing screen searches for the T-1000, which suddenly emerges from the side and kicks away the launcher. There is a nasty and violent fight between the two Terminators, in which they pound each other against the metal surfaces around them. The T-1000 is thrown head first against a steel wall, but it quickly morphs itself backwards, ready to fight again. The Terminator punches into its head, but its opponent simply liquefies, reforms around the Terminator&#39;s fist, launches it against some more walls, and finally forces its arm between two large cog-wheels. Out of reach, the T-1000 takes on its human texture again and leaves the Terminator stuck in the machinery.Sarah and John take a few steps towards a platform. The Terminator picks up an iron bar and uses it to amputate its arm to free itself. John and Sarah see the T-1000 already coming up to the platform. Sarah lowers John along a chain onto a conveyor belt below, but stays behind herself, despite John&#39;s desperate calls to come along. Sarah reloads her shotgun and fires at the T-1000&#39;s head: it leaves a large hole around its right eye, which fills up quickly. It figures out that John has escaped. Before Sarah can reload and fire another shot, the T-1000 extends one of its fingers and skewers her left shoulder to the wall. It orders Sarah to call John, but she refuses. It tortures Sarah by moving its finger-blade inside her wounded shoulder, threatens to pierce her head with its other finger, and repeats the order, but she still doesn&#39;t comply. At that moment, the Terminator takes a slice at the T-1000 with the iron bar, almost chopping off its arm and side. But the T-1000 kicks the Terminator back, mends its body and simply pulls the bar out. It pounds the Terminator with the bar, throwing the Terminator in front of a large suspended beam. The T-1000 uses the beam to crush the Terminator against the wall several times, causing its right eye to come out and exposing its red robotic eye and metal skull. The heavily crushed Terminator attempts to pull itself away with its remaining hand, towards a lower platform where its grenade launcher still rests. But before it can grasp the launcher, the T-1000 forces the metal bar into the Terminator&#39;s chest. It retracts the bar again, but before the Terminator can make another attempt at the launcher, the T-1000 forces the bar all the way through it and the grated floor. Electrical discharges erupt from the metal body as the red dot in the Terminator&#39;s eye slowly dies and its body goes limp.Sarah grabs her shotgun and reloads with the little remaining strength she has. John crawls out of the conveyor belt tunnel and hides behind some equipment. The Terminator&#39;s mechanical eye seems to come back to life. Its internal processing screen shows that an alternate power route inside the metal body has been found, and the eye becomes fully red. It pulls the iron bar from its body and the floor and grabs the grenade launcher.In his hiding place, John hears his mother calling him. He walks several steps and platforms over to her, to find her limping along a wall. She asks for his help, but then another Sarah appears behind her, armed with a shotgun. She tells John to get out of the way. John looks down to see that Sarah&#39;s feet have seemingly been fused to the grated floor, and realizes it is the T-1000 (played by Linda Hamilton&#39;s identical twin Leslie Hamilton Gearren). John yells &#34;shoot!&#34; and a large metal hole appears in the T-1000-as-Sarah&#39;s body. In an instant, the wound closes and the T-1000 morphs back into its familiar cop face. Sarah fires a volley of shots at the T-1000, which brings it staggering towards the edge of the platform, above one of the molten metal pools. But as it&#39;s one step from falling in, Sarah&#39;s shotgun is empty. The T-1000 heals its wounds and Sarah fires again, but the gun only clicks. The T-1000 makes a childish naughty-gesture with its finger, then starts advancing on John and Sarah. They turn around to see the Terminator emerging on a conveyor belt, armed with the grenade launcher. They get down, and the Terminator fires his grenade into the T-1000&#39;s gut. It gives a look of astonishment before the grenade violently explodes inside; its body is completely burst open, the head and arms hanging from mere threads, as it loses its balance and falls screeching into the pool of molten metal. The effect is devastating: as John and Sarah watch, the T-1000 splashes and thrashes in the pool, screaming in agony, uncontrollably morphing through the forms it previously adapted: the policeman, Janelle , Lewis, the motorcycle cop. Desperately screaming and fighting, several more heads and arms pop out of its body. It takes the rough shape of a giant open-mouthed head that turns inside-out, before it finally returns into a terrified face that dissolves in the metal, singling it&#39;s death.John helps the Terminator up. It looks like a wrecked car and says it needs a vacation. They look at the molten pool and John asks if the T-1000 is dead. The Terminator replies that it is terminated. John throws the metal arm and the chip in the steel. Sarah sighs that it is over, but the Terminator reminds her that there is still one more chip which must be destroyed; it points at its skull. It hands Sarah a remote control for one of the electrically operated pulleys, saying that it cannot self-terminate and needs to be lowered in the molten steel. Sarah looks confused, but John can&#39;t accept this, and pleads with the Terminator to stay with them. When it apologizes and tells him that it has to do it, John tearfully orders it not to go. The Terminator remains silent for a while, looking John in the eyes, and tells him it knows now why he cries; but it is something it can never do. John hugs the android, which shakes Sarah&#39;s outstretched hand, then grasps one of the chains. Sarah activates the pulley, lowering the Terminator into the pool. Its clothes burn as it slowly melts away from below in the hot steel. It looks up to John, who is in tears. After the hot metal immerses the face, its hand does a final thumbs-up before it sinks in the molten metal. There is a last look into its internal processing screen, which goes static, and finally blacks out like a TV screen. Sarah drops the remote and holds the sobbing John to her shoulder. The camera flies over the highway at night again as Sarah speaks: &#34;The unknown future rolls towards us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.&#34;Credits roll to the Terminator theme music and &#34;You Could Be Mine&#34; by Guns &#39;N Roses.



|1h 28min|[Action, Adventure, Comedy] |Kay and Jay reunite to provide our best, last and only line of defense against a sinister seductress who levels the toughest challenge yet to the MIBs untarnished mission statement: protecting the earth from the scum of the universe. It&#39;s been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. And now it&#39;s a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay-who not only has absolutely no memory of his time spent with the Men In Black, but is also the only living person left with the expertise to save the galaxy-to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to ultimate destruction.

Here is one of their stories that (making quotations marks with his fingers) &#39;never happened&#39;, from one of their files that doesn&#39;t exist.&#34; Crude props and effects accompany the story:&#34;1978. Leaders of Zartha flee their planet in order to escape the clutches of the evil Kylothian Serleena.&#34; (Serleena is represented by a jumbled mass of hoses). &#34;Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring with them their greatest treasure -- the Light of Zartha -- a cosmic force so powerful, that, in the wrong hands, it could spell the annihilation of Zartha. The Zarthans&#39; princess, Lauranna (Paige Brooks), beseeched the Men in Black to hide the Light from Serleena. But they had no choice. Intervention would have meant the destruction of the Earth.&#34; (Serleena&#39;s space ship lands. It looks like an 8-ft tall metal ice cream drumstick with three landing legs.) &#34;However, in an act of galactic bravery, the Men in Black subdued Serleena, allowing the Zarthans to escape so they might hide the Light on another planet. Serleena, released from her captors, vowed that the Light would be hers, and that she would destroy any planet that stood in her way.&#34; (The reenactment ends.)Peter Graves finishes: &#34;And so, never knowing what happened, the people of Earth were once again saved by a secret society of protectors known as the Men in Black.&#34;Over the opening credits, Serleena&#39;s space ship flies through space, destroying planets it passes. It finally reaches Earth in July 2002.A dog in New York Central Park barks at the sky. The dog runs and gets away from the owner. Serleena&#39;s ship crash-lands in Central Park. The landing legs protrude and then extend to upright the ship. Out of the bottom opening, a tiny creature (Serleena) ejects onto the ground. The dog catches up to the ship (which is only a few inches tall) and barks at the creature, which looks like a strange mouthless serpent. The serpent&#39;s head opens up and roars loudly, scaring the dog away. The serpent slithers across the ground, coming across a magazine. Wind blows the pages open to an ad for Victoria&#39;s Secret; the female model wears black lingerie. The head opens wide and then hundreds of serpents come out, screeching and shrieking, forming a full-sized replica of the model in the magazine (Lara Flynn Boyle). Immediately after Serleena fully forms, a rapist dressed in leather grabs her and holds a knife to her neck. He licks her and tells her that she tastes good, and then drags her to a nearby bush. Hidden from view, Serleena roars and eats the man, his legs visible as she eats him upside down. Serleena says, &#34;Yeah, you too.&#34; She walks back from the bush, her stuffed stomach sloshing and gurgling, and then looks at the ad again. She growls then walks back to the bush and vomits the rapist, then comes back out slim again, carrying his clothing, then walks away.Men in Black (MiB) Agent J, &#34;Jay&#34;, (Will Smith) and his latest partner, Agent T, &#34;Tee&#34;, (Patrick Warburton), encounter a flower protruding from a sidewalk grating. Jay tells Tee, &#34;Nothing fancy, no heroics, by the book this time.&#34; Tee replies, &#34;Got it,&#34; then kicks the flower. Jay talks into the grating, telling &#34;Jeff&#34; that they&#39;re wondering what he&#39;s doing here. Tee kicks the flower again, and Jay looks at him, irritated. Jay continues his rebuke of Jeff, reiterating their arrangement: as long as Jeff stays within the &#34;E&#34;, &#34;F&#34;, and &#34;R&#34; subway lines, he can eat all the inorganic matter he wants. Tee grabs the flower and pulls on it, asking &#34;worm boy&#34; what he&#39;s doing. The grating shakes and Jay tries to calm Jeff. Jeff, a giant worm hundreds of feet long, bursts through the grating. Jeff takes Tee screaming with it into the air, holding onto the flower on its head. As Jeff takes Tee up, Jay apologizes to Jeff for his partner, who is &#34;new and kind of stupid.&#34; Jeff throws Tee onto the ground, and then withdraws back into the hole. Jeff&#39;s tail bursts out of the ground nearby and knocks Jay screaming into a fruit stand.Jay jumps into the first hole, landing on Jeff as it speeds through a subway tunnel. Jay bumps his head on the overhead, and then holds onto the flower. Jay&#39;s head knocks into some passing overhanging metal, and then he injects Jeff with the tranquilizer. After dodging more overhanging metal and some signals he pokes his hand and bumps his head again. Commuters are waiting by a station. They watch a subway train pass by, then watch Jeff pass by shrieking the other direction with Jay yelling. The commuters look back at their phones, magazines, and newspapers as if nothing abnormal happened. Jay has the hypo ready and raises it up to inject Jeff again, but it throws him screaming through the window of the subway car up ahead. Jay gets up and shows his MiB ID card to the passengers, telling them that he&#39;s from the Transit Authority. He tells them to move to the forward car because &#34;there&#39;s a bug in the electrical system,&#34; but no one even notices him. Jay repeats his request, telling them that there&#39;s a bug in the electrical system, then looks back. On cue, Jeff takes a bite out of the rear of the subway car, then the passengers scream and run to the forward car. Jay sarcastically tells them to sit down because it&#39;s only a 600-foot worm. Jeff takes another bite of the subway car. Jay tells the motorman, Capt. Larry Bridgewater (Peter Spellos), to &#34;put the hammer down,&#34; but he tells Jay that he decides what happens on the train. Jeff then takes a bite out of that subway car, and Capt. Bridgewater rushes to the control console. Jay walks to the rear of the subway car and threatens Jeff with his blaster, so Jeff closes its mouth and stops chasing them. Sparking as metal drags the ground, the shredded subway car limps into the 81st Street Station. Jay announces the arrival to the passengers. He steps out and zaps the passengers with his neuralizer, then sarcastically thanks them for participating in New York City&#39;s drill; had it been an actual emergency, they would have been eaten. He then lectures them about not listening, being ignorant and &#34;seeing it all,&#34; and ignoring his request to move to the next car. They recover, and Jay zaps them with the neuralizer again. He thanks them for participating in a drill, and hopes they enjoy the new smaller, more energy efficient subway cars. Jay walks away and zaps the motorman too.Jay calls MiB headquarters to secure the perimeter and to send a clean up crew to 81st and Central Park West. He then orders MiB to revoke Jeff&#39;s movement privileges immediately and escort him back to the Chamber St. station. He finally requests a check of the expiration date on the unipod worm tranquilizer. When he climbs the stairs out of the station, he tells two men that the station is closed for a drill; they become indignant. Jay says, &#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34;Jay sits on a bench and Tee comes back to sit with him. Tee knows that he didn&#39;t go &#34;by the book.&#34; Jay asks him when he last looked at the stars, and if he ever felt alone in the universe. Tee isn&#39;t much for conversation. Finally Jay takes Tee to eat some pie.Scrad (Johnny Knoxville), a two-headed humanoid alien, returns to his place after a night on the town. His other head grows out of his back on a tentacle -- it&#39;s his smaller twin Charlie (Johnny Knoxville) whom he keeps in a backpack; both are equally stupid. Scrad is scolding Charlie for &#34;talking behind my back&#34; and chasing away a woman at a bar. Scrad turns around and sees Serleena, but doesn&#39;t recognize her. Charlie tries his pick-up line on her. Serleena strangles them with her serpent tentacles, and Scrad finally recognizes her. She tells him that she got his message, and asks where the Light is. Charlie wants $50 million to tell her, but Serleena puts tentacles through their ears and noses. Scrad tells her that although they couldn&#39;t find the Light, they tracked it to a guy who might know where it is; he runs a pizza parlor on Spring St. They all leave.Jay and Tee eat pie at the Empire Diner. It has a flying saucer sticking out of the roof, as if it crashed. Tee starts blubbering because he knows that Jay&#39;s going to neuralize him. Jay tells him to stop making a scene, and then asks him why he joined MiB. Tee replies that after six years in the Marines, he likes to serve, likes the action, and likes to protect the planet. Jay tells him that since he likes being a hero, he joined the wrong organization. Jay asks Tee if he heard of James Edwards (himself), but Tee says no. Jay says that he saved the lives of 85 people on the subway, but no one knows that he exists; therefore, how can anyone ever love him. Tee sobs loudly some more. Jay zaps Tee with the neuralizer. Jay tells Tee to get married and have a bunch of kids. As Jay leaves, he tells a waitress that his buddy is kind of shy, but thinks that she is hot. The waitress and Tee smile at each other.At Famous Ben&#39;s Pizza of Soho, Ben (Jack Kehler) (Laura&#39;s boss) presents Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) with the &#34;Employee of the Month&#34; plaque on the wall. She gets a case of Mountain Dew from the basement. When she returns to the parlor, Serleena is holding Ben in the air, and is demanding that he give her information about the Light of Zartha. Ben claims that he doesn&#39;t know anything. Laura calls on the phone to report a robbery, then the back door pops open. Serleena repeatedly orders the dense Scrad to check on the door, so Laura hides under the counter. Scrad reports that the wind blew the door open. Serleena tells Ben that although she traveled the universe for 25 years looking for the Light, it never left Earth; they (the Zarthans) kept it on Earth. Ben still claims that he doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about. Laura peeks over the counter. Serleena tells Ben that even though they hid the Light, she will find it, and then Zartha will be theirs (the Kylothians). Ben finally answers in a deep alien voice that she&#39;s too late; at midnight the Light will leave the 3rd planet and be back home. Serleena growls then slashes him with a tentacle, splitting him in two and killing him, and his skin (a rubber-like suit) falls to the floor. Charlie complains that Ben is dead, and they didn&#39;t get any information from him. Serleena reminds the idiot that Ben said &#34;third planet.&#34; Serleena tells them that the Light is on Earth, and she knows who will tell her where it is. She takes a pan of pizza and they all leave. Laura cries silently while she sits on the floor behind the counter. Thunder rumbles then she looks up and it rains.Jay returns to MiB headquarters. The guard (Alpheus Merchant) wonders if Jay ever goes home and remarks that he neuralized another partner. When he goes to the customs bay, Jay immediately gives orders to various personnel how to do their jobs. He finally asks why a dead Tricrainasloph is going through passport control. (It looks like a giant pink blob with many tentacles.) Several men are trying to move it, including using a pallet jack. Jay goes to Zed&#39;s office, and Zed (Rip Torn) congratulates him on his work at the subway. Jay asks Zed what he has for him. Zed replies that others work at MiB too and can handle it. Jay asks again, but Zed refuses again. Jay tells Zed that he&#39;ll be in the gym if Zed needs him, so Zed finally tells him about the killing at the pizza parlor. Zed tells Jay to take Tee with him and make a report. Jay tries to tell Zed about Tee, but Frank (the alien talking pug) (voiced by Tim Blaney) comes in and interrupts them. Zed tells Jay to stop neuralizing MiB personnel, but Jay says that Tee was crying in the diner. Jay adds that Elle (Dr. Laurel Weaver, Linda Fiorentino, seen in Men in Black (1997)) doesn&#39;t count, because she wanted to go back to the morgue. Zed tells Jay that he needs a partner and Frank volunteers.In the garage, Frank, wearing a black suit, runs to keep up with Jay. Jay makes him remove the suit. Frank then talks endlessly as Jay brings his car out with a remote: a black 2003 Mercedes-Benz E-Class W211. A man (later revealed as the automatic pilot) is at the wheel. Jay drives down the street, and Frank hangs his head out the window while singing the song &#34;I Will Survive&#34;. Jay makes Frank come back inside the car, but he hums the song instead. Finally Jay makes him be quiet.When they reach Famous Ben&#39;s Pizza, Frank wants to do the &#34;good cop/bad cop&#34; routine, but Jay tells him to just shut up. Jay meets two MiB agents in the parlor, who tell him that there&#39;s a phosphorous residue on the wall and floor, which they sent to MiB for analysis. Frank makes a joke about Ben, still on the floor: &#34;Zero percent body fat.&#34; The two MiB agents laugh but stop when Jay stares at them. They tell Jay that there was a witness, Laura Vasquez, whose name they wrote on a napkin. The napkin shows a pizza slice pointing at the Statue of Liberty, whose torch points at a star in the sky. Another MiB agent in the kitchen is questioning Laura, who wants answers of her own. Jay goes to the kitchen to handle it, but makes Frank stay there and &#34;sniff around.&#34; The agent in the kitchen is telling Laura that everything will be all right, but Jay counters that and makes him leave. When she describes what she saw, Jay tells her that Ben&#39;s skin isn&#39;t really skin, but is a protoplasma polymer chemically similar to material used in baseball card gum. He then takes her to eat pie.At Empire Diner, Laura tells Jay that Serleena kept asking Ben about a light, the Light of Zartha. He asks her if she&#39;s OK, but she sarcastically tells him that an hour ago a man she&#39;s known her entire life vanished in front of her eyes because of a woman with things coming out of her fingers and a two-headed guy with the &#34;IQ of a cannoli&#34;, but everything is OK. Laura says that she knows what she saw, and asks Jay what she&#39;s supposed to believe. He tells her that he&#39;s a member of a secret organization that polices and monitors alien activity on Planet Earth; Ben was an alien, and so were the people who killed him. Jay says that he doesn&#39;t know why they killed Ben, but he will find out. Jay pulls out his neuralizer and points it at her, and she expects that he&#39;ll kill her. He tells her that it will flash and put everything back the way it was before. She wonders that after he &#34;flashes&#34; her, if she&#39;ll know it&#39;s him if she sees him again. He replies that he&#39;ll see her but she won&#39;t see him. He points the neuralizer at her, but she tells him that it must be hard and lonely. A bicycle bell rings, and Jay looks out the window to see two people riding a tandem bicycle again, their clothing and the bike covered with lights (as seen in Men in Black (1997)). One of Jay&#39;s devices beeps, and he puts away the neuralizer. She asks about the &#34;flashy thing&#34;, and he tells her that he&#39;ll flash her some other time. Jay goes outside and finds Frank in the car barking rhythmically to the song, &#34;Who Let the Dogs Out&#34; (by Baha Men). Jay turns off the radio and then gets in and starts the car. Frank asks Jay if he told the girl that he loves her, but he replies that she&#39;s just a witness to a crime. Frank knows that Jay is attracted to her, but Jay refuses to take his advice.Jay and Frank arrive at the park where Serleena landed and killed the rapist. Many MiB personnel are there and have secured the area. When Jay and Frank get out, Frank tries to act important, telling everyone that he&#39;s Agent Eff, Agent Jay&#39;s new partner. An agent laughs at Frank, so Frank attacks him. Jay goes inside a tent and finds Serleena&#39;s spaceship, then calls Zed on a communicator, which looks like a cross between a videophone, a Game Boy, and a PDA. Jay tells Zed that the space ship is Kylothian, Class &#34;C&#34;. Zed replies that it&#39;s Serleena&#39;s. Jay tells Zed that the witness said that the perps were looking for the Light of (Zed finishes) Zartha. Zed replies that it doesn&#39;t make sense, because the Light is not on Earth; they took care of that a long time ago. Jay retorts that obviously they didn&#39;t. Zed tells Jay that it&#39;s very bad news; 25 years ago the Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena. Jay says that they don&#39;t do that. Zed replies that it&#39;s why he ordered it off the planet. Jay asks Zed if he&#39;s sure the Light isn&#39;t still here, because of the Kylothian ship in the park. Zed replies that he&#39;s positive, because his best agent carried it out, just as if he ordered Jay to do it. Jay says that they should ask the agent, but Zed replies that they can&#39;t -- he&#39;s &#34;dead&#34; -- he works at the Post Office. Jay is shocked. Zed tells him that if Serleena gets to Kay before they do, he&#39;s dead; Earth&#39;s existence may depend on Kay&#39;s knowledge, but Jay wiped out Kay&#39;s memory of it. Zed orders Jay to bring Kay in.Jay and Frank go to retrieve Kay. Frank rambles on about how cool it is to get the great agent Kay, Jay&#39;s mentor. They arrive at the small town of Truro, Massachusetts, and Jay tells Frank to stay in the car. Inside the post office, Kay grins when he sees that the former Agent Kay, Kevin Brown (Tommy Lee Jones), is now the postmaster. Kevin is reminding customers to properly wrap their packages. Jay walks up and addresses Kevin as Kay, but he replies, &#34;C, Express Mail, two-day air.&#34; Jay tells Kevin that although he doesn&#39;t remember Jay, they used to work together. Kevin replies that he never worked in a funeral home and asks &#34;slick&#34; how he can help him. Jay tells him that Kay is a former agent of a top-secret organization that monitors extraterrestrials on Earth; they are the Men in Black, have a situation, and need his help. Kevin tells him to go to the free mental health clinic. Kevin calls the next customer, a girl (Chloe Sonnenfeld) who wants to buy some &#34;Rugrats&#34; stamps. Jay picks up the girl and sets her back in line. He tells Kevin that there was no coma; it was a cover up. Kevin orders him to leave, but Jay calls him Kay again. Kevin walks to the back office and Jay follows him in. Kevin informs the postal employees that they&#39;ve had a breach, then orders them to cordon off the area and do a full wipe down, and to escort nonessential civilian personnel off the site (acting like he still works at MiB). As Kevin looks on, Jay researches one of the employees on his communicator. Jay speaks to him in an alien language that sounds like beatboxing. The man (Biz Markie responds in the alien language. All the other employees (including one that looks like Howard Stern) stop work to observe the conversation. Kevin looks around in disbelief as the other employees reveal themselves to be aliens too. Jay tells Kevin that the reason why he&#39;s so comfortable there is that just about everybody who works in the Post Office is an alien. Jay opens the mail-sorting machine, revealing a eight-armed alien (Jeremy Howard) instead of machinery. (The song &#34;Speed Demon&#34; plays.) Kevin removes the alien&#39;s cigarette and tells him, &#34;No smoking.&#34; When Kevin gets back up, the alien puts another cigarette in his mouth and continues sorting mail. Jay catches up to Kevin, who is trying unsuccessfully to start his Jeep. Kevin tells him that in Las Vegas he and his wife saw Siegfried and Roy fly a white tiger around a room; Jay&#39;s act is nothing special. Jay responds that when Kevin looks up at the stars he feels like he doesn&#39;t know who he is, like he knows more about what&#39;s going on out there than down here. Jay tells him that it&#39;s why his wife left him and Kevin punches Jay in the nose. Jay tells Kevin that if he wants to know who he really is, to come ride with him; otherwise he can give people their TV Guides. Kevin gets in the car and tells Jay that he&#39;s just going for a ride; if things don&#39;t add up he will leave. Frank asks Kevin, &#34;How&#39;s it hanging,&#34; but he just stares at the dog.At MiB headquarters, the guard greets Kay, but he doesn&#39;t recognize the guard. In the main bay, two men and a flying device greet Kay. Agent Gee (Sid Hillman) is awestruck by Kay, &#34;the legend, the most respected agent in the history of MiB, the most feared human in the universe -- in the flesh.&#34; He goes to get coffee for Kay, but runs away before Jay can give him his coffee request. Michael Jackson (Michael Jackson) calls Zed from amongst a flock of penguins in Antarctica. He reports that the Drolocks are gone and the treaty is signed. Zed tells him that it&#39;s good work. He asks Zed about the position at MiB that Zed promised him, but Zed replies that they&#39;re still working on the alien Affirmative Action program. He tells Zed that he wants to be Agent M, but Zed hangs up. Zed greets Kay and tells him that the Earth might be in trouble and he&#39;s the only one who can save it. Kay starts quoting the Post Office motto (&#34;Neither rain nor sleet nor snow...&#34;). Zed tells Jay to get Kay armed, up to speed, and to deneuralization. As Jay and Kay leave, Zed makes Frank stay behind because he needs Jay and Kay together on this assignment. Zed tells Frank that he&#39;s looking for a new assistant; although it&#39;s not fieldwork, it provides better dental coverage. Frank smiles appreciatively, showing his bad teeth.Jay takes Kay into the tech unit, which holds the most advanced technologies from all over the universe. Kay sees a blue globe on a stand and sticks a finger in the globe. The globe is actually a miniature planet full of tiny aliens, who scream at the finger coming from the sky and run away. Jay hears the screams and tells Kay not to touch it; he quickly removes his finger and says that he didn&#39;t do anything. Jay tells Kay to put his hands in his pockets. Jay opens the armory and gives Kay his &#34;favorite weapon&#34;: the Noisy Cricket (the same weapon Kay issued Jay in Men in Black (1997)). Jay then takes Kay to put on the last suit he&#39;ll ever wear -- again.After Kay gets his suit, Jay takes Kay to a room with plain white walls. The deneuralizer hangs from the ceiling over a hole in the middle of the floor. Jay explains its operation to Kay: &#34;In a few moments, transverse magneto energy will surge through your brain, unlocking information hidden deep and dormant that could hold the key to Earths very survival.&#34; Kay points to the deneuralizer (which is the only thing in the room) and asks what it is. Jay replies that it&#39;s the deneuralizer, then he sighs.At Earth customs, Scrad/Charlie wait while a customs agent (Peter Spruyt) asks for Serleena&#39;s name and planet of origin. She replies, &#34;Sylona Gorth. Planet Gorn. Kaluth system.&#34; When the agent asks if she has any fruits or vegetables, she motions to Scrad/Charlie and replies, &#34;Yeah, two heads of cabbage.&#34; The agent asks for her reason of visit, and she replies that it&#39;s for education, that she wants to learn how to be an underwear model. She unzips her vest and flashes her bra at the agent. Scrad/Charlie faint; Charlie recovers and yells for help, then attempts CPR on Scrad. Other MiB agents, who were watching Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart) on the big screen TV, run over to help. Serleena shoots her tentacles out and snares the agent who was waiting on her. The alarm sounds and a female voice announces &#34;Lockdown. Code 101.&#34; on the P.A. system. When Frank hears the alarm he hides behind the tentacles of the dead Tricrainasloph, which has been stuffed into a corner. Serleena subdues the rest of the MiB agents with her tentacles.Jay hears the alarm and tells Kay that there is a breach, and that they&#39;re being firewalled and flushed. He helps Kay out of the deneuralizer before it starts. Jay tells Kay that being flushed is like going to a water park, but Kay doesn&#39;t know if he ever went to one. There is a loud flushing noise, then blue liquid floods the room. The overhead view shows that the room is shaped like a giant toilet bowl, complete with a seat (and the deneuralizer has retracted). The water swirls through the drain hole, taking Kay and Jay with it. They shoot through clear tubes and end up in two metal capsules in Times Square. The capsule doors open and the water pours out. Jay jokes with Kay, telling him that when Kay was an agent he loved to be flushed. He tells Kay not quit on him. Kay responds with, &#34;I save the world, you tell me why I stare at the stars.&#34;Jay brings his car to the curb with the remote. He presses a button on the remote, and the automatic pilot gets sucked into the steering wheel. Kay asks if it&#39;s standard, and Jay replies that it came with a Black dude, but he kept getting pulled over.Serleena has stuffed the MiB agents in some offices, subdued by her writhing tentacles. As she walks away, she remarks that she could rule this silly little planet with the right set of mammary glands. While driving, Kay brings up MiB surveillance on the computer, which shows that MiB is deserted -- lockdown. He calls Frank on the communicator. Frank tells Jay that some &#34;hot-looking biker chick&#34; did it. Jay tells Frank to stay where he is, and that he&#39;ll keep in touch. Serleena asks Scrad/Charlie if they found Kay. They reply that he&#39;s a civilian; he was here to be deneuralized because his memory was erased, but he&#39;s gone. They assure Serleena that they will find Kay.Kay finds an old photo of himself in his coat pocket and shows it to Jay. It&#39;s the left half of a picture that was cut off, and Kay is smiling and pointing to his right. They both wonder what is means. Kay asks Jay if there is another deneuralizer besides the one at MiB. Jay replies that it&#39;s the only official one; the plans leaked out on the Internet a few years ago. Jay finds one for sale on eBay by Jack Jeebs (whom they went to in Men in Black (1997)).Jay and Kay arrive at Jeebs&#39; pawnshop at night. Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) greets Jay enthusiastically but is surprised to see Kay, because he thought Kay was retired. Jay tells Jeebs that they need the deneuralizer, but he looks at Kay and asks if Kay remembers him. Kay replies that he doesn&#39;t, that he&#39;s pretty good with faces, and would remember that (pointing to Jeebs nose). Jeebs laughs because Kay is &#34;a neutral.&#34; Kay tells Jeebs that he&#39;s in the way of his memories, and asks Jeebs if he has the deneuralizer. Jeebs says that he doesn&#39;t have it. After a stare down by Kay and Jay, Jeebs remarks that even if he did have it, Jay would blow his head off if it doesn&#39;t work and Kay dies, and Kay would blow his head if it works. Jay holds a fission carbonizer to Jeebs&#39; head, so he takes them downstairs to the deneuralizer.Serleena has released MiB&#39;s alien prisoners, &#34;the scum of the universe&#34;, to help her get Kay: a guy with a funny chin and wearing a scarf; a White guy; a bald guy with pointy ears, a misshapen nose, and tendrils on his face; and a Black Guy. She tells them that she needs the Light of Zartha and Kay knows where it is; whoever brings Kay to her gets Earth. She tells Scrad/Charlie to find a deneuralizer because Kay needs it to get his memories back. She then greets Jarra (John Alexander), a very tall alien, who glides forward to meet her.Kay is seated and strapped down in the deneuralizer and Jeebs is giving him safety instructions. Jeebs sticks a tube in Kay&#39;s mouth. Jeebs delays by asking Kay irrelevant questions, but Jay shouts at him so he starts the deneuralizer (with an outboard motor). Jeebs tells Jay that he only used the deneuralizer once, to make hot air popcorn with the exhaust. Clamps come down against Kay&#39;s head. A strobe light flashes in Kay&#39;s face and a large fan spins above the chair, then the chair shakes. Jeebs presses a key on the keyboard, then some eggbeaters spin and a bowling ball goes down a ramp around the deneuralizer chair. A alarm sounds and flashes, then the deneuralizer stops, then all the power there and in New York City goes out. After a few seconds, the power comes back on and the deneuralizer starts back up. The chair shakes violently then tilts back, then ejects Kay gasping (with the seat back) onto the floor. Jay and Jeebs lean over Kay to check on him, and then Kay blows off Jeebs&#39; head with the Noisy Cricket. Jay thinks that Kay is &#34;back&#34;, but he says that he&#39;s not. Jay asks him how he knew that Jeebs&#39; head would grow back, but he didn&#39;t know that it would. As his head grows back, Jeebs says that it&#39;s the last time he helps out a friend. Jay asks Kay if he remembers anything, but he just says goodbye. As Kay rushes up the stairs, Jeebs tells him that that he never got the updated software for the deneuralizer, and that Kay&#39;s brain needs to reboot.Jeebs apologizes to Jay, and hopes that it doesn&#39;t affect their friendship, &#34;all those years of loyalty and trust, respect for one another.&#34; Immediately afterwards, Serleena&#39;s henchmen break through the walls, and Jeebs directs them to Jay. They shoot at Jay then ask for Kay, but Jay shoots Jeebs&#39; head then tells them that Kay retired and he&#39;s his replacement. The alien with face tendrils jumps through the ceiling and they subdue Jay, throwing him to the floor. Scrad asks Jay where Kay is, but Jay feigns ignorance. The White alien grabs Jay but Jay punches his face, knocking the mask off. The alien looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon with a lumpy face &amp; head (Corn Face) (Michael Garvey). Jay tells him that he looks like crap, then another alien laughs (the one that looks like a dog with a poop-covered head) (Dog Poop) (Sonny Tipton). Jay corrects himself, saying that that the other alien looks like crap. The Black alien orders that they &#34;bend him.&#34; Corn Face picks up Jay over his head and starts &#34;bending&#34; him. Kay walks outside and looks around. He sees: the two lighted guys on the tandem bike; a homeless man pushing a shopping cart, with a crab-like creature with lights for eyes peeking out from under a blanket; two hookers dressed for Halloween; and a USPS mail carrier with a tail hanging out from his shorts. Kay then sees a cockroach crawling on the ground and goes to step on it, but he changes his mind. The roach thanks him. Kay looks up at the stars for a while, and then finally smiles. Corn Face is still &#34;bending&#34; Jay. Scrad tells the thugs that he thinks Jay is telling the truth, so Corn Face says that he&#39;s no good to them. Kay comes in and shoots Dog Poop and Corn Face. He defeats the other thugs using Jay&#39;s advice on their weaknesses. The Black guy is Pineal Eye (Kevin Grevioux); Kay removes the hat and pokes his eye. The alien with tendrils on his face is Mosh Tendrils (Derek Mears); Kay pulls his tendrils and slingshots him into the ceiling. When Kay kicks the last thug between the legs, it makes a metallic clank. Jay tells Kay that he&#39;s a Ball-Chinnean (Michael Dahlen); Kay pulls down his scarf, revealing testicles, and kicks them, knocking him out. Kay has his memory back and is Jay&#39;s partner again. Jay asks Kay what&#39;s going on, and what is the Light of Zartha, but Kay doesn&#39;t know.Outside, Jay asks Kay why he doesn&#39;t remember what the Light of Zartha is. He replies that he must have neuralized himself to keep the information from himself. Kay goes to the driver&#39;s side of Jay&#39;s car, telling Jay that he always does the driving. Pointing to Kay and himself, Jay replies that Kay and his car are old and busted, and Jay and his car are new hotness. Kay stares at Jay until he gives him the remote.At MiB, Serleena is holding Zed in the air with her tentacles. She releases her tentacles and he falls to the floor, then she kicks him. She tells him that they both need the same thing, and then she kicks him again, knocking him into his chair. She shoves Zed&#39;s cell phone to him, but he refuses to bring Kay in. She reminds him that the Light will self-destruct if it&#39;s not off the Earth by midnight, annihilating the planet. She tells him that they can both lose or both win, because he doesn&#39;t want the Light on Earth any more than she does. Zed dials his phone and hands it to her, telling her that she wins. Michael Jackson answers, still asking Zed if he could be Agent M. Zed knocks Serleena over the head with his lamp then jumps and flips over her. He kicks her in the face several times, but nothing fazes her. She knocks him to the floor with a tentacle, then kicks him in the face and knocks him out. She then notices a tentacle of the dead Tricrainasloph move.Jay tells Kay what the fastest way to MiB is but he passes it. Jay tells him that they need to go to MiB because headquarters has been breached; they have to &#34;bust in there, and peel some caps, and split some wigs up in that joint.&#34; Kay replies that he&#39;s not ready. Jay says that Kay&#39;s been gone for five years, which is a long time in this game; he understands if Kay is scared, because he is too. Kay replies that he&#39;s not scared, so Jay says that neither is he; he thought they were bonding. Kay tells him that after five years, he&#39;s still acting like a rookie by talking about splitting wigs and stepping on caps; it&#39;s no wonder Zed brought him back. Jay counters that Zed brought Kay back because he messed up. Kay says that Jay&#39;s attitude is creating a very stressful work environment. Jay says that MiB has a stressful work environment. Kay says that Serleena thinks that Kay knows where the Light is, so she broke into MiB to lure him back. Jay adds that it&#39;s a trap -- which is why they shouldn&#39;t bust into MiB. They go to the &#34;scene of the crime&#34;: Famous Ben&#39;s pizza.Jay tells Kay that he&#39;s going to talk to the witness. Kay wonders why he didn&#39;t neuralize her, according to MiB procedures, which he quotes. Laura swings a pizza tray at Kay, but he ducks and she hits Jay&#39;s face instead. Jay introduces Kay to her. She thanks Jay for sending some agents to watch her last night. Kay rebukes Jay again, quoting MiB procedures. Jay talks about the crime, then Kay notices a photo of Ben holding a large fish. The clouds over the fish were removed, as if done by Photoshop. Jay takes Kay&#39;s picture and places it over the photo, matching it perfectly. Jay notices that Kay left himself clues. Kay is pointing at something, so Jay puts his head against the wall (bumping a green key &amp; key ring hanging on the wall), and follows the direction across the room. Kay sees the key and sighs, and tries to stop Jay. Jay reaches a photo on the wall of an astronaut pointing, and repeats his procedure. Kay just shakes his head in disappointment. Jay reaches some pizza boxes stacked on their corners, and wonders who would stack pizza boxes like that. He deduces that the stacker was leaving clues, and that the pizza slice is an arrow. The camera zooms in on the photo then on the key, which is labeled &#34;GCT&#34;. Kay again tries to stop Jay, but he says that Kay is slowing him down. Jay finally reaches a steel cabinet and takes out a can of anchovy fillets in virgin olive oil. Kay shakes the key and tells Jay that he hopes he&#39;s not slowing Jay down. Kay pulls out his deneuralizer but Jay stops him, saying that Laura could be important to him -- to them, and could help them later. Kay puts away his deneuralizer but says that she can&#39;t stay there because they (the aliens) will be back, then he walks out. Jay takes her to stay with some of his &#34;friends&#34;.Jay takes Laura to the Worms&#39; place, a large suite with a low ceiling, and he bumps his head. Jay tells them that MiB is Code 101, and introduces Laura. He stops their catcalls and apologizes for them, but Laura replies that she&#39;s dated worse. Jay tells her that the Worms are under suspension right now for stealing from the duty-free shop. Kay comes in and reminds Jay that the car is double-parked. Jay tells the Worms that Laura is very important to him, then adds to them (Jay and Kay), to the stuff they&#39;re doing. Kay then leaves. Jay asks them to watch Laura. They are very enthusiastic about it. Jay hands her his communicator in case she needs it and she kisses him. All the worms &#34;wooo&#34; and laugh. Jay tells her to watch out for Neeble, but has to ask them which one is Neeble; the Worm in the jacuzzi (voiced by Thom Fountain) answers. Jay tells her that it&#39;s safe but not to fall asleep, then leaves. The worms start a game of Twister, and Laura smiles.Jay catches up to Kay and reviews Kay&#39;s plan because it confuses him: since Kay neuralized himself and erased his memory of the Light of Zartha, he left himself clues; the photo from an old suit points to a key in a pizzeria; the key opens a locker at Grand Central Terminal, which will give them another clue. Kay replies that it&#39;s right, because he likes to keep his enemies confused. Jay says that they&#39;re all confused.At Grand Central Terminal, Kay tells Jay not to slow him down, and then sends him to get them coffee while he opens the locker. Jay becomes indignant, but Kay says that he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s in there and Jay could get hurt. Kay opens the locker, revealing hundreds of tiny aliens in a tiny town. The town is full of discarded ordinary items from Earth, plus miniature buildings from a department store. The aliens hail Kay, and then start to sing the Star Spangle Banner, with Kay&#39;s name inserted. Kay asks them if he left anything there. They say that he did: the timekeeper (Kay&#39;s watch) -- to illuminate their streets and their hearts. Kay takes back his watch from the clock tower and puts it on, and they panic. Jay takes off his watch and puts it on the clock tower, so they now hail Jay. Kay starts to close the locker, but they tell him that he forgot the commandments on the tablet. They chant, &#34;The tablet! The tablet!&#34; The mayor (Peter Siragusa), an alien that looks like Moses, says that they have lived by its word, and peace has reigned throughout their world; pass it onto others, that they too may be enlightened. The others chant: &#34;Be kind. Rewind.&#34; Kay takes the &#34;tablet&#34;, which is a business card from Tapeworm Video Store. The mayor tells Kay to go back and reconcile his past so that he can move tranquilly into his future. The others chant &#34;Two for one, every Wednesday&#34;, then &#34;Large adult entertainment section in the back.&#34; All the aliens then turn around and laugh and rush into a XXX &#34;fun zone&#34;. Jay says that it&#39;s just nasty, and closes the locker. Jay asks Kay what the video card is for, but he doesn&#39;t know. Jay then asks Kay what the watch is for. Kay replies that it&#39;s to remind him that they have until midnight, which according to his watch is less than an hour away.Kay and Jay arrive at Tapeworm Video. Jay wants to stop chasing ridiculous clues. He wants to get a couple of fission carbonizers and take back headquarters, but Kay tells him that it&#39;s all about to make sense. He gives his card to the clerk (Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine), but she says that it hasn&#39;t been used in years, before she was born. Kay tells her that he&#39;s been away on business. Jay adds, &#34;billions of frequent flier miles.&#34; The clerk says that it&#39;s hard to use them, and then rambles on about wanting to go to Cambodia, how you can get a lobster dinner for a dollar. Kay stops her, so she tells him that he never checked out a video, but reserved one and didn&#39;t pick it up. She calls her boyfriend Newton (David Cross), the manager, who comes back from the bathroom. He&#39;s paranoid about aliens. He tells Kay that he reserved &#34;Episode 27: Light of Zartha&#34;, and tells Kay that they&#39;ve got it.At MiB HQ, Serleena asks Jarra why he was locked up. He replies that Agent Jay caught him siphoning the Earth&#39;s ozone to sell it on the black market. She tells him that she needs a spacecraft that can go 300 times the speed of light. He tells her to give him Jay and it will be even. She agrees and gives him until midnight, and then he glides away. Serleena calls Gatbot, which looks like a steel cylindrical trash can, for a special job.Newton takes Kay and Jay upstairs to his bedroom, which he has devoted to aliens. He lives with his mother. Newton&#39;s girlfriend tells him that she wants to have his baby. His mother yells to him offering him mini pizza, and he offers some to Kay and Jay. They just stare at him. Newton yells back that they don&#39;t want any, then gets the videotape. Jay is relieved that they finally have some hard evidence. Newton starts rambling about aliens and anal probing, but Jay prods him to play the tape.As the video plays, Jay remarks that it looks like Spielberg&#39;s work. Newton starts saying the words along with the video, but Kay and Jay stare at him so he stops. When the video talks about the Keeper of the Light, Kay says softly,&#34; Lauranna,&#34; and Jay looks at him. Kay also says, &#34;No. It was night... and it was raining.&#34;The scene changes to a black-and-white flashback of the way it actually happened. Serleena tells Kay, &#34;You&#39;ve been very wise.&#34; Ambassador Lauranna (Linda Kim) says, &#34;Kay, please, if Serleena gets the light, it&#39;s the end of our world.&#34; Kay replies, &#34;Madame Ambassador, if we extend the protection of the light beyond the Earth, we put the Earth itself in jeopardy. We have no choice. We must remain neutral.&#34; Serleena asks, &#34;Where is it?&#34; Kay replies, &#34;We&#39;re neutral, remember? You want it, go get it.&#34; He uses his watch to launch a spaceship. Serleena shouts &#34;No!&#34; She shoots Lauranna, killing her, and then chases after the spaceship with her own spaceship. Kay bends over Lauranna, and then opens his hand to reveal a bracelet.Back in the present, Kay is crying silently as the video finishes: &#34;And so, never knowing it happened, the people of Earth were once again saved by a secret society of protectors...&#34; Kay turns off the video and says that he &#34;shouldn&#39;t have.&#34; Jay deduces correctly that they didn&#39;t send the Light off the planet and hid it on Earth. Kay says, &#34;The Worm Guys,&#34; and goes downstairs; he neuralizes Newton&#39;s mother. Newton recognizes the neuralizer just before Jay neuralizes Newton and his girlfriend. Jay tells Newton to get contacts instead of his glasses, then to take his girlfriend to Cambodia for a lobster dinner (and to pay more than a dollar); when he gets back from Cambodia he should move out his mom&#39;s house. Jay finishes with saying that there are no such things as aliens or Men in Black. Newton takes off his glasses and asks his girlfriend if she wants to go to Cambodia, and she agrees. Newton picks up a shovel as they go downstairs and he calls his mother.While Kay drives, Jay calls Laura on his communicator. She tells him that they (she and the worms) are playing Twister. Jay asks her if she&#39;s wearing a bracelet. She replies that she is. Kay asks her if it&#39;s glowing, and she replies that it never did that before. (The bracelet is the same one that Kay held in the flashback; the triangle shape on it is glowing now.) Jay tells her that they&#39;re on the way. Jay calls Frank and tells him to deactivate the lockdown because they&#39;re on the way to the worm guys and they found the Light. Frank is tied up and Serleena acknowledges in Frank&#39;s voice. Serleena leaves Frank and calls for Scrad. Frank mumbles, &#34;Bitch.&#34;Kay asks Jay why he didn&#39;t tell Laura that he loved her. Kay knows that Jay is in love with her, which is why he didn&#39;t neuralize her; he got emotionally involved. Jay retorts that Kay did the same with Lauranna. Kay tells Jay that he (Kay) put Earth in danger because he got involved, and doesn&#39;t want to see Jay make his mistakes.Kay and Jay arrive at the Worm Guys&#39; place; it&#39;s wrecked and the Worms are seriously injured. Jay asks them where Laura is. They reply that some dumb two-headed guy took her to MiB headquarters. Kay says that they (Serleena and the others) have the bracelet, and that there&#39;s only 39 minutes left, so Kay and Jay leave. The Worm Guys chase after them. Jay asks Kay why she took Laura if she has the bracelet. Kay replies that she also wants him (Kay). They go get some &#34;wig-splitting&#34; weapons.A man, his wife, and their daughter are watching Martha Stewart on TV. Kay and Jay barge into their apartment. Kay tells them that he used to live there and came to pick up a few things, then moves the thermostat control left and right and left quickly. The back wall of the living room slides up, revealing walls and cabinets full of weapons. Mannix the Worm (voiced by Brad Abrell) remarks that it&#39;s a nice place. The Worm Guys, Jay, and Kay get some weapons. Kay closes the back wall with the thermostat then Jay neuralizes the family.Inside MiB headquarters, Jarra has completed constructing a spaceship; pieces of rockets and machinery litter the room. Laura is in the spaceship. A female voice announces on the P.A. that there&#39;s 4 minutes to launch. Jarra informs Serleena that her ship is ready, so she tells him to send it to Kyloth now.Outside MiB headquarters, Jay aims his weapon to shoot a hole in the building, but Kay tries to stop him. Jay fires anyway, and they get sucked in and lose their weapons. Kay rebukes Jay for shooting MiB because it&#39;s in Code 101 lockdown. A hot dog stand gets sucked in too, and the umbrella plugs up the hole. The guard calmly picks a hot dog off his suit and says that it&#39;s about time they got there, because &#34;that pretty lady in there is causing all kinds of hell.&#34; He resumes reading The Weekly World News.The elevator opens to the MiB main bay, and Gatbot opens up, extending its rotary machine guns. It shoots the elevator full of holes, but Kay, Jay, and the Worms are hiding against the ceiling. Kay tells Jay to get to the launch pad on the roof; the bracelet shows the departure point. He also orders Jay not to come back for him. Kay hangs down and gives cover fire against Gatbot with his blasters while Jay runs to the other elevator, which leads to the roof. Kay then sends the worms through the elevator ceiling to shut off the power to the launch pad so that the spaceship can&#39;t take off. Gatbot enters the elevator and Kay throws a grenade down, and then jumps out of the elevator before the doors close and the grenade explodes. Serleena is waiting for him, and captures him with her tentacles.Jay reaches the spaceship, but Jarra blocks his way. Jarra has been locked up for 5 years and 42 days. Jarra drops his cloak to reveal that he&#39;s made up of four parts: one large flying ship and three smaller flying ships -- all with his head and torso, and metal tentacles hanging down. One of the smaller Jarras takes away Jay&#39;s blaster.Kay tells Serleena that he should have vaporized her when he had the chance. She remarks that he really loved Lauranna. She calls him a silly little man and sticks her tentacle tongue into his ear.Jay tries unsuccessfully to reach the larger Jarra because of the smaller ones. A female voice announces on the P.A. that there&#39;s two minutes to launch. Laura tells Jay to go and that she&#39;ll be fine, but Jay replies that he&#39;s winning. He tells Jarra that he&#39;s arresting him for being that ugly and making copies of himself. Jay picks up a scrap pipe and bats away one of the small Jarras, knocking it against a wall and destroying it. Another small Jarra takes Jay away and drops him, but he lands safely on some large clear tubing.The Worm Guys -- Mannix, Neeble, Sleeble (voiced by Greg Ballora), and Gleeble (voiced by Carl J. Johnson) -- walk down a passageway. They forgot Kay&#39;s instructions on where to shut off the power.Jay and the large Jarra charge at each other and collide, then Jarra takes Jay around the room. Jay punches a small Jarra and it hits a machine and gets destroyed. Jay covers large Jarra&#39;s eyes, then grabs the control lever, then large Jarra crashes into the remaining small Jarra, destroying them both. Jay jumps away in time and lands on the tubing. As Jay struggles to get off the tubing, a female voice announces on the P.A. that there&#39;s 30 seconds to launch. Jay finally gets off the tubing then turns off the countdown before it reaches zero. He releases Laura and tells her that he didn&#39;t leave her because he never runs out on a fight.Serleena has Kay in the air. She calls Kay an insignificant speck and tells him that he lost. She says that he wasted 25 years of her time for the complete and total annihilation of Zartha, because he went mushy. Kay tells her that she has one last chance to surrender. Serleena asks him how he can stop her, but Kay says that it&#39;s not him. Jay shoots her with a large weapon, telling her that her flight has been cancelled, and vaporizing her. Kay falls to the floor.Mannix lands in the control room and presses a random button, turning off all the power in MiB. Kay brings the car over with the remote. Jay tells Laura to give him the bracelet. She tells him that she&#39;s going with them, and Kay tells him that she should get in the car too. They drive away, revealing that Serleena was only stunned. The tiny creature sends out tentacles again.As they drive, Laura remarks that it&#39;s hard to believe that everyone is after her charm bracelet. Jay replies that she would be surprised how often it&#39;s something small like that. Kay tells him them that it&#39;s not the Light -- it shows the departure point; if they don&#39;t reach the departure point in 11 minutes &amp; 15 seconds the bracelet will go nuclear and destroy all life on Earth. Suddenly Serleena rams the back of the car with her spaceship. Jay tries to stop him, but Kay presses the red button on the shift lever. The car transforms into a flying rocket car, slamming them against the seats. They fly through Times Square with Serleena chasing them. Jay tells Kay that the car is modified to hyper speed. Kay tells them to put on their seatbelts, but they don&#39;t. A handle-type steering wheel (with controls similar to that of a game console) comes out of the dash and Jay tells Kay that it&#39;s the navigational stalk; he has to use it during hyper speed. Kay grabs the navigational stalk and sends the car upside down; Jay and Laura didn&#39;t put on their seatbelts and fall to the ceiling. Serleena shoots the car several times as they fly over New York Harbor. Jay tells Kay how to use the controls and he rights the car; Laura and Jay fall onto the back seat. Jay climbs back into his seat and calls the worms at MiB. Frank and the Worm Guys are drinking martinis and smoking cigars, and Frank is telling them about one of his &#34;chicks&#34;. Jay tells Frank to use the computer to lock onto Serleenas ship and destroy it. Serleena shoots the car, breaking the communication. Frank says that Jay was the best damn partner a Remoolian could ever have. Kay activates the automatic pilot, which pops up in front of him, but it doesn&#39;t work. Jay tells him that it doesn&#39;t operate at hyper speed and retracts the automatic pilot. Kay replies that he&#39;s used to a steering wheel, but Jay says that it&#39;s all they have. Jay asks Kay if his mother ever gave him a Game Boy, buy Kay asks what that is. Jay and Kay switch seats in mid flight. They fly into the subway with Serleena still shooting at them and she calls them idiots. Kay tells Jay that the subway is not the best place to lose her, but Jay shushes him and wonders where Jeff is. Kay asks who Jay is talking about and they see Jeff straight ahead. Jay lands the car at the last second and Serleena flies into Jeffs open mouth, who then chews and swallows her spaceship. The automatic pilot pops up in front of Jay.They land on the rooftop of a tall building. The car transforms back to normal and they get out. Jay tells Kay that they&#39;re running out of time and asks him where the Light is, and Kay says that Laura is the Light. Laura is incredulous. Kay tells her that she has a planet to save, but she replies that he has her confused with somebody else; she works part-time at a pizzeria. Kay tells her that two days ago he was running a post office in Truro, Massachusetts; you are who you are. While Kay explains Laura&#39;s purpose on Earth, Jay sees the triangular-shaped skylight, which matches the triangle shape on Laura&#39;s bracelet, and then pulls out the napkin from Famous Ben&#39;s Pizza. Kay is telling Laura that she is the Light; she&#39;s the leader of her people, their spirit and their hope; the power is within her to save the planet; &#34;I protected you until it was your time. Your time is now. You were hidden on Earth 25 years ago to...&#34; Jay looks at the Statue of Liberty then looks up and sees the star. &#34;Kay continues: You are going to save a world. You know things before they happen.&#34; She replies that she can&#39;t; she&#39;s a Libra. Kay tells her that she is a Zarthan; when she gets sad it always seems to rain. She replies that lots of people get sad when it rains. Kay tells her that it rains because she&#39;s sad. The &#34;star&#34; emits a bright beam of light onto a large egg-shaped object on the roof, transforming it into a transport pod, and it opens up. Jay leans against the car dejectedly, and then he and Laura look sadly at each other. Even though they realize it&#39;s not fair, Jay and Laura accept her destiny. Suddenly Jeff bursts through the skylight, roaring and baring his teeth. Jay shouts at Jeff, saying that he&#39;s not in the mood for him, and orders him to get back in the subway. Jeff bursts apart, revealing a giant serpent: Serleena. As Kay takes Laura to the transport pod, Serleena shoots out tentacles toward Laura. Jay jumps in front of Laura, so the tentacles get him instead. Jay shouts at Laura that she has to go. Kay shoots at Serleena with his blaster and assures Laura that Jay is fine and does this all the time. As Jay struggles with the tentacles, he shouts at Laura that it&#39;s her destiny. Kay shoots at Serleena then tells Laura that if she doesn&#39;t go they will all die. He shoots at Serleena again without looking, and then tells Laura that she&#39;s just as beautiful as her mother. Laura gets into the transport pod and it closes. Kay shoots many times at Serleena and it finally retracts, releasing Jay. It rains in the transport pod as it takes her into the sky to the &#34;star&#34;. Serleena flies after Laura, a giant face visible in the front of the tentacles, so Jay and Kay take two large weapons from the car&#39;s trunk. Kay thanks Jay for bringing him back. Jay asks Kay why he didn&#39;t tell him about Laura. Kay rhetorically asks if Jay would have let her go. They shoot at Serleena, hitting her/it just before she/it reaches the transport pod. Serleena explodes over the Statue of Liberty, creating a giant fireworks display lasting several seconds. Jay asks Kay what it&#39;s like on the outside, &#34;you know, not doing this every day?&#34; Kay answers, &#34;It&#39;s nice. Sleep late on the weekends. Watch the weather channel.&#34; Kay sighs and says that he missed this city. The transport pod has disappeared into the &#34;star&#34; and the bright light fades. Jay asks Kay that if Laura is Princess Lauranna&#39;s daughter, did they...? (Jay surmises that Kay is Laura&#39;s father.) Kay ignores him and tells him that they have to go because MiB is a mess. They put the weapons back in the trunk. As they walk to the elevator, Jay asks Kay how they can go because thousands of people in New York and New Jersey just saw this event; they need a cool thought out plan. Kay puts on his sunglasses, prompting Jay to put on his. Kay presses a button on his watch, and then the torch on the Statue of Liberty buzzes and flashes: a giant neuralizer. Kay tells Jay that he&#39;ll get him trained yet. Jay gets jealous of Kay&#39;s watch.Back at MiB in the locker room, Kay sits down next to Jay, who is getting dressed. Kay tells Jay that they&#39;ve all been there; the girl is gone and it hurts. He asks Jay if he wants to talk about it, because he can help. Jay replies, &#34;No.&#34; Zed sits down opposite them and thinks that Jay is still sulking, but Jay says that he&#39;s not. Zed says that Jay misses her; it happens to all of them. Zed then starts talking about how he and his girlfriend were entwined in positions from the Kama Sutra, which grosses out Jay so he makes Zed stop. Frank comes in from the shower and tells Jay about &#34;dames&#34;, about what they really want. Frank shakes off, forcing the others to stand. Frank asks Jay if he&#39;s &#34;still sitting shiva.&#34; Jay tells Frank &#34;No advice&#34;; he tells Kay &#34;No talking&#34;; he tells Zed &#34;Hell no.&#34; Jay swears that he&#39;s fine. He opens his locker; the tiny aliens are in it with their town, and they hail him; he quickly closes his locker. Kay tells Jay that he brought them over from Grand Central Terminal and put them in Jay&#39;s locker because he thought it would put things in perspective for Jay. Jay tells Kay that they need to let the aliens out of his locker so they will know that the world is a bigger place than that. Kay takes him to a black door marked: &#34;DANGER! NO EXIT. DO NOT OPEN. NOT AN EXIT! UNAUTHORIZED USE WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE REVOCATION OF ALL M.I.B. ACCESS CLEARANCES. IN CASE OF EXTREME EMERGENCY DO NOT OPEN&#34;. Kay sighs and tells Jay that he&#39;s still a rookie. Kay kicks the door open, revealing to Jay and Frank a giant room full of aliens; their door is actually a door to a locker that contains Earth, among hundreds of lockers at an alien type of Grand Central Terminal.Will Smith sings &#34;Black Suits Comin&#39; (Nod Ya Head)&#34; during the closing credits.Synopsis written by Mu_Ve_Watchr_89.







|2h 18min|[Action, Crime, Sci-Fi]     |Sean Archer, a very tough, rugged FBI Agent, is still grieving for his dead son Michael. Archer believes that his son&#39;s killer is his sworn enemy and a very powerful criminal, Castor Troy. One day, Archer has finally cornered Castor, however, their fight has knocked out Troy cold. As Archer finally breathes easy over the capture of his enemy, he finds out that Troy has planted a bomb that will destroy the entire city of Los Angeles and all of its inhabitants. Unfortunately the only other person who knows its location is Castor&#39;s brother Pollux, and he refuses to talk. The solution, a special operation doctor that can cut off people&#39;s faces, and can place a person&#39;s face onto another person. Archer undergoes one of those surgeries to talk to Pollux.

Archer must stop Troy again. This time, it&#39;s personal.                Written by
John Wiggins                                       |September 1991:In a flashback, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is taking his six year old son Michael for a ride on the Griffith Park carousel in downtown Los Angeles. As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael&#39;s face and smiles.Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse&#39;s mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son&#39;s body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.Six Years Later:Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI&#39;s Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt. Castor is a career terrorist, responsible for countless terrorist bombings, aircraft hijackings, and political assassinations, among other crimes. Archer looks at a wall documenting a long list of commendations given to him for his years of dedicated hard work and service, then somberly holsters his pistol and approaches his coworkers. We see that Archer carries the burden of his son&#39;s death on his shoulders at all times from his walk. He is agitated that his closest agents, Tito Blondi (Robert Wisdom), Wanda (Margaret Cho), Buzz (James Denton), and Loomis (Matt Ross) have no information on Castor&#39;s latest whereabouts.Meanwhile, Castor poses as a minister to sneak into the Los Angeles Convention Center, where he assembles and arms a big bomb called &#34;Sinclaire&#34;. As he leaves, he cannot resist the opportunity to headbang to a choir singing the Hallelujah chorus and grope a blonde choir girl.At the FBI office, Archer finishes up a heated phone call with director Victor Lazarro (Harve Presnell). His secretary Kim Brewster (Romy Windsor) comes in to inform him that his wife Eve is on line 1 trying to call him. But simultaneously, Tito bursts in to tell Archer that Castor&#39;s brother Pollux just chartered a jet at a local airfield and paid it in cash. Archer immediately orders Tito to get an undercover agent planted on the plane. Tito is about to protest that they don&#39;t have any sign of Castor, but Archer counters Pollux &#34;doesn&#39;t fly without big brother!&#34; and marches out of the office, ignoring the fact that his wife is on hold.Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) is shown waiting impatiently in his convertible on the tarmac of a local airfield with his cronies Leo (Tommy Flanagan) and Lars (Dana Smith). He is relieved when Castor drives up in his own car. He climbs out and walks over to Pollux, and converses as Leo and Lars change his coat and sunglasses. Pollux is annoyed that Castor is running 26 minutes behind schedule. Castor lights a cigarette and asks Pollux if he hasn&#39;t deviated from their plans. Pollux admits that he paid for the jet himself to save them time. Castor reminds him that that is for the boys to handle so they can hide their movements, but he&#39;s not going to kill Pollux for such a screw-up because he loves him too much to do such a thing. He then bends over and quickly ties Pollux&#39;s shoelaces. Castor then tempts Leo and Lars with a gold money clip of $100 bills, only to snatch them away. He and Pollux then break into grins as he advises his men to stay away from downtown on the 18th, when things are going to be a little.... &#34;smoggy&#34;. Castor and Pollux then board the plane, where they are greeted by Winters, an undercover agent posing as a flight attendant, whom Castor quickly seduces.As the plane turns and prepares to start its takeoff roll, the pilot suddenly sees a Humvee on the runway, driving towards them. Simultaneously, Pollux looks out the window just as multiple police cars and a helicopter suddenly appear behind the jet and give chase. Castor gets up from his seat and rushes into the cockpit to take a look at the oncoming vehicle. Not to his surprise, Archer is driving the car, and Tito is riding shotgun.At that point, Winters whips out her pistol and trains it on Castor. Pollux promptly throws his briefcase at her, holds her down, and beats her senseless. Castor puts a pistol to the pilot&#39;s head and orders him to fly the plane. The plane and Archer continue to close in on each other. It looks as if Archer is on a collision course with the landing gear, but he swerves at the last second and drives past the plane, then swings a U-turn to fall in line behind the plane. Archer then floors on the gas pedal. He has pulled up alongside the wings when the cabin door suddenly opens and Castor pushes the disarmed Winters out the door, and makes Archer watch him execute her with a bullet to the back. Archer stops the Humvee and promptly jumps into the helicopter, and takes off before Tito can protest.Seeing Archer closing in, Castor puts his pistol to the pilot&#39;s head and orders him to take off. Archer promptly lowers the helicopter and rams the skids against the left wing flaps, jamming them. The pilot makes several futile attempts to pull back on the throttles, until the flaps break off completely. Trying to see what is keeping his plane on the ground, Castor peeks out the wing exit door. He raises his pistol and fires at Archer. Several bullets pierce the glass, but Archer ducks down, unharmed. Castor ducks back inside, while Archer sticks his pistol out and shoots out the left engines. Sparks issue from the engines and the engine fire alarm goes off on the pilot&#39;s control panels. Castor promptly executes the pilot, takes his seat at the controls, and quickly diverts the plane off the runway, putting it on a collision course with a hangar. Castor powers down the throttles, just seconds before the nose of the plane smashes through the glass windows in the side of the hangar and sends debris and parts flying everywhere.Archer lands the helicopter as the other police units screech to a halt around the back of the plane and officers begin taking up positions. Sparks fly as Castor whips out twin pistols, jumps out of the plane, and opens fire. One agent standing on the wing of the plane is shot dead instantly, as is a cop standing on the ground. Pollux draws a submachine gun, fires a volley at Archer, and jumps out, following Castor. Archer jumps onto the roof of a police car and fires his pistol. Tito fires a submachine gun, driving Pollux further back into the hangar. Castor then breaks cover and fires both pistols rapidly. In the exchange, Loomis is hit, a bullet shearing off part of his left ear.Castor calls out to Pollux, but Archer shoots at a water hose pipe. The bullet bursts a joint in the pipe, spraying water into Pollux&#39;s face. Pollux is driven out from cover, at which point Tito grabs him from behind and shoves him into a wooden shipping crate. Wanda then kicks him in the chest, then throws him on his stomach and handcuffs him. Meanwhile, Castor ambushes and shoots a SWAT officer at point-blank range with his pistol, then uses the officer&#39;s shotgun to shoot another agent. He then turns to see Tito and Wanda handcuffing Pollux, who cries out to Castor. Castor ignores him and rushes deeper into the hangar. A few agents haul Pollux away while Archer and a group of agents and cops rush in and split up to search for him.Deeper in the hangar, Castor hides and lies in wait. Archer enters, his pistol drawn, searching between the stacks of shipping crates. He turns his weapon when he hears the echo of Castor reloading his pistol. Archer breaks cover and finds another agent, Berkeley, in the line of fire. He shouts a warning to Berkeley, but it comes too late. Castor turns and fires, hitting Berkeley in the back and killing him instantly. Archer fires once at Castor. Castor fires his shotgun at Archer, sending Archer scrambling for cover. Castor then drops the shotgun and draws his second pistol. Another agent, Buzz (Jamie Denton), draws his pistol and breaks cover. Archer tackles him to the ground just as Castor turns on Buzz and opens fire. Archer raises his pistol and his backup revolver and fires back at Castor. They continue firing until both run out of ammunition.Archer takes cover behind a wooden shipping crate and reloads his pistol. Simultaneously, Castor reloads his pistols. Hearing the sound of clicking, he looks up to see Castor standing above him. Archer scrambles behind some crates as Castor opens fire on him again. Archer shoots a hook tying a steel pulley chain to the ground, grabs the chain, and uses it to take the high ground as he fires at Castor. Castor slides down a ramp, firing and shooting a submachine gun-wielding agent. He lands next to an active turbine.Before Castor can stand up, Archer lands next to him and jams his pistol to his neck. Castor laughs and dares Archer to shoot him because he only has one round left in his weapon. They stand up and train pistols on each other. Engaged in a Mexican standoff, Castor tries to convince Archer to turn against his fellow men and try terrorism-for-hire, though it is clear he&#39;s trying to provoke Archer. Castor takes the opportunity to brag that he has a bomb that will deliver &#34;Hell&#34;-A the biblical plague it deserves, though Archer believes he is bluffing. Castor also brags that he knows Archer will just drive his family crazy now that his enemy will be locked up.Asking if Archer&#39;s daughter Jamie is &#34;ripe&#34;, Castor tries to shoot Archer, but the magazine clicks empty. He gets on his knees and breaks down, seemingly scared, but it is actually an act as we see that he is using the opportunity to secretly grab a knife from his pocket. Then he breaks into a grin and dares Archer to pull the trigger, singing, &#34;I&#39;m ready! Ready for the big ride, baby!&#34; He promptly stands up, knife in his right hand. Archer kicks Castor&#39;s hand, disarming him. He then kicks Castor into the backdraft of the turbine. Archer hits a button and the turbine produces a sudden blast of hot air that sends Castor flying backwards until he hits a ventilation grate and falls motionless.Archer returns home, and we see that his family life is less than optimal. His daughter Jamie gets in trouble a lot, and his relationship with his wife Eve seems somewhat distant due to all of the time he&#39;s spent looking for Castor. Nonetheless, he assures Eve that he will petition his boss to grant him a desk job so he can spend time rebuilding their relationship.Back at the office, the employees congratulate Archer as he slowly walks into the office, looking crestfallen. His secretary gives him a bottle of champagne that has been sent by the CIA to commend Archer for stopping Castor. Archer tries to refuse it, unhappy with the fact that it says &#34;Just for you&#34; and does not have the names of all the agents shot dead in the shootout.Archer logs onto his computer and presses some buttons to declare the Castor Troy case closed. He is interrupted when Tito and a Special Ops agent, Hollis Miller (C.C.H Pounder), come in. Miller produces a floppy disk found in Pollux&#39;s briefcase. Archer plugs it into his computer. Graphics of an animated woman come up to the tune of suggestive music, as well as the sound of audible moaning. The words &#34;My name is Sinclaire, and I am going to blow you AWAY!&#34; show up on the screen. As &#34;AWAY!&#34; shows up, the animated woman briefly flashes into a skeleton. Schematics of &#34;Sinclaire&#34; show up on the screen. Archer identifies it as a biological weapon. Miller warns that the fall out would be enough to flatten much of LA, and Archer realizes Castor was not bluffing about a biblical plague.Getting more information on the bomb, though, is more difficult because Pollux will only talk about the bomb with Castor, and Castor is presumably deceased. An attempt to interrogate Pollux about the bomb schematics fails due to Pollux fooling the polygraph, and Archer refuses to take Lazarro&#39;s suggestion that he just let the matter go. Miller tells Archer that they could put an undercover agent in a prison cell with Pollux to get him to slip information, but Archer shoots that down. Miller proposes that there might be an alternate solution.Miller takes Archer out to the Walsh Institute, a private medical institution that specializes in various types of state-of-the-art surgical operations. Archer enters the recovery ward, where, to his disbelief, he sees that Castor is in a medically induced coma and is on life support. Miller assures Archer that Castor is not going anywhere, demonstrating this by stubbing out her cigarette on Castor&#39;s skin, to which Castor does not even twitch. Miller, and the institute&#39;s director Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore), give Archer an ambitious proposal: they would like Archer to take Castor&#39;s face and voice, then go into Erewhon Prison posing as Castor to extract information on &#34;Sinclaire&#34; from Pollux.Dr. Walsh reveals that he is capable of performing surgeries to alter the facial appearance or voice of a person. To demonstrate, he and Miller show Archer into the observation deck for another operating room where surgeons are working on Loomis, the agent shot in the ear during the shootout with Castor in the hanger. As Dr. Walsh continues talking, lasers are shown constructing a new earlobe, that is then surgically stitched onto the stump of Loomis&#39;s original ear. Dr. Walsh explains that the surgery they propose Archer undertake to become Castor is much less permanent than what Loomis is getting. He explains the more technical details: Archer&#39;s blood type does not match Castor&#39;s but this will not be something Pollux will notice, and the height difference is easy to correct. Archer&#39;s skin and eye pigment color is also close enough to Castor&#39;s to be a reasonable match. Laser shears will be used to trim Archer&#39;s hair to Castor&#39;s length and appearance, microplugs to build up additional chest hair, an abdominoplasty that rebuilds Archer&#39;s midsection to more closely resemble Castor&#39;s. Dr. Walsh then shows Archer the true innovation: a morphogenetic template, the inside of which is modeled on Archer&#39;s skull but has an exterior modeled to resemble Castor&#39;s face, meaning he won&#39;t feel any different at all.Archer finds the whole plan insane and starts to leave, but Miller stops him, reminding him that he has chased Castor for many years. He is convinced that getting Castor&#39;s gang to talk is easier, even though Miller warns him that Castor will effectively win if the bomb blows up.Archer decides to instead first try interrogating known associates of Castor&#39;s. On the first two guys he tries to interrogate, he grills them so intensely that one of them pees in his pants. Late at night, he interrogates Castor&#39;s longtime girlfriend Sasha Hassler (Gina Gershon). She refuses to talk at first, but Archer warns her that she is on probation for previous criminal charges including harboring Castor, and gets her to talk by threatening to put her son Adam up in a foster home. She finally claims that she hasn&#39;t seen Castor in years. Archer then interrogates Sasha&#39;s brother Dietrich (Nick Cassavetes), who functions as Castor&#39;s bomb and weapons supplier. Archer tells him that the bomb has his signature written all over it. Dietrich scoffs, stating Archer has no real evidence against him. Things go sour when Dietrich decides to insult Archer by asking him about his deceased son. Archer snaps with rage, tackles Dietrich to the floor, and jams the barrel of his pistol into Dietrich&#39;s eye. Dietrich finally admits that all he knows is that the bomb goes off on the 18th.As he watches Sasha and Dietrich leave the office, Archer is met again by Tito and Miller. Archer does not want to submit to the operation without Lazarro being notified, but Miller tells him that this is actually a black bag operation, meaning that it is classified and off-the-books (no paperwork), and Archer is not allowed to tell Lazarro or Eve anything about the mission. Feeling that he has nothing to lose, Archer accepts the mission.After giving farewells to Eve and Jamie, Archer heads to the Walsh Institute and prepares for the surgery. He gives Tito his wedding ring and tells him to hold onto it for safekeeping. He asks Dr. Walsh if he can also restore the scar from the bullet wound Archer received from Castor years ago after the operation is over. Dr. Walsh agrees. Archer leaves Tito and follows Dr. Walsh to prepare for sedation.The surgery begins. Archer and Castor are both sedated, then are wheeled into the operating room on separate tables. Dr. Walsh first uses a pen to trace the area of skin to be removed from Archer&#39;s face. He then uses a special laser to run along the line and isolate the skin. A suction cup is then lowered, and pulls off the entire section of skin comprising Archer&#39;s forehead, eyelids, nose, mouth, cheeks, and chin, exposing the raw muscles. Dr. Walsh then deposits the original skin on a facial template stored in a container of water to keep it from drying out. The same process is then repeated on Castor while a technician cuts Archer&#39;s hair. Castor&#39;s face is then put on top of Archer&#39;s exposed muscles and then connected to the rest of his skin muscles. Then the blood vessels are reconnected and the surgery is completed.A few days later, Castor is back in his own hospital bed, his head wrapped up in bandages like a mummy. Meanwhile, Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage) wakes up and his bandages are unwrapped. He freaks out upon seeing Castor&#39;s face in the mirror and tries to destroy it with the base of a coat hanger. He is quickly calmed down by Miller and Tito, who administer a sedative. Archer calms down, and he asks Tito and Miller to burn his new face once he&#39;s gotten the information he needs.Archer then notices that his voice hasn&#39;t changed yet. This problem is fixed with the next part of the operation. Dr. Walsh implants a microchip in Archer&#39;s larynx, and warns him to be careful as something as mundane as a sharp blow or violent sneeze could dislodge it. Dr. Walsh then plays back a short clip from an audiotape of Castor talking normally (in which he states &#34;Peach. I could eat a peach for hours&#34;), and instructs Archer to repeat back the line. It takes a few tries, but eventually Archer is able to get his voice to perfectly emulate Castor&#39;s. Archer is reminded that he has six days until the bomb goes off to get information from Pollux.Meanwhile, at the LA Convention Center, the bomb&#39;s clock continues counting down.Archer is next seen being led by Tito up to the helicopter landing pad where guards from the Erehwon Prison (&#34;Nowhere&#34; spelled in reverse) are waiting to pick him up. Tito tells him he has two days to get Pollux to talk, after which Miller will come in to withdraw him regardless. Archer is still complaining about an itch as he adjusts to his new face. Tito helps him by massaging his cheeks with his thumbs. Two prison guards grab Archer and begin leading him to the helicopter. He gives a longing look towards Buzz, Wanda, Loomis and Tito as they see him off. A blindfold is then lowered over Archer&#39;s face.When Archer&#39;s face is unmasked again, he is shirtless and under a bright spotlight in a dimly lit room, being watched over by several guards. The prison warden, Walton (John Carroll Lynch), comes in, shines a flashlight in Archer&#39;s face, and analyzes him, telling him, &#34;You are now the property of Erewhon Prison. A citizen of nowhere. The Geneva Convention is void here; Amnesty International doesn&#39;t know we exist. When I say your ass belongs to me, I mean exactly that.&#34; Archer&#39;s feet are then clamped tight in magnetic boots tied to a field that allows the guards to monitor the location of every prisoner 24/7.Archer is then shown in the cafeteria line, trudging along as a nature channel plays images of various landscapes 24/7 on a large TV monitor. All of the inmates stop what they are doing upon seeing Archer. Archer comes dangerously close to blowing his own cover when he&#39;s stopped by another inmate that he recognizes as Burke Hicks, whom he arrested many years ago for stalking the UN Secretary General, a crime for which Hicks has always claimed he was framed. Archer is turning around and about to talk to Pollux when another inmate, a hulky Russian named Ivan Dubov, who seeks revenge on the real Castor ever since Castor had three-way sex with his wife and sister, attacks him. Dubov gives Archer an intense beating, throwing him around, leaving Archer with a bloody nose. After a brief moment to catch his breath, Archer regains his composure, and eventually gets the upper hand, defeating Dubov with a lunch tray. He&#39;s shocked at how close he&#39;s come to becoming the very likeness of his enemy. At the end of the fight, Archer&#39;s magnetic boots are clamped to the EM field and Walton prods him in the back with a stun gun. He then warns Dubov of the consequences he will face the next time he picks a fight with someone.Back at the Walsh Institute, the real Castor is still asleep. His heart rate begins accelerating, and then he suddenly bolts upright. He is stunned to find that his face is completely wrapped in bandages. He pulls them off and discovers that the skin on his face is gone, leaving the muscle exposed. He touches the exposed muscles to verify that he is not hallucinating. Despite being in great pain, he hobbles over to the edge of the room and sees Archer&#39;s old face floating in a jar. He calls Lars and Leo on a phone in his wing and tells them to come immediately.Lars and Leo abduct Dr. Walsh and transport him to the Institute in their car. They march him to the operating room at gunpoint, where they find Castor sitting in a chair, smoking a cigarette and watching the videotape of the surgery while listening to classical music (the video itself was recorded so Dr. Walsh could undo the surgery after the mission was completed). Watching the tape finish, Castor starts clapping, finding the entire thing very impressive. Castor advances towards Dr. Walsh, who, frightened, asks Castor what he wants. Castor claps his hands several times and we see his faceless face appear reflected in Dr. Walsh&#39;s glasses to reply, &#34;Take one goddamn guess.&#34;Back at Erehwon, Archer sits down with Pollux and successfully manages to extract information from him about the bomb. Later, he is in his cell when a guard stops by to tell him that he has a visitor. Archer is escorted to the visitor&#39;s room. Once he is in the room, the magnetic boots are activated, securing Archer&#39;s feet to the floor. He is hoping the visitor is Miller and Tito coming to release him. Instead, to his shock, in walks Castor Troy (now played by John Travolta), wearing Archer&#39;s old face and business suit, and all too happy to see that Archer is locked up in prison under his name. He likens the effect as being like looking into a mirror, only not. He is mildly annoyed about having his face cut off to disturb his coma and thrusts a newspaper article into Archer&#39;s face about a recent fire that destroyed the Walsh Institute and killed Dr. Walsh and two of his lab technicians.Hearing the news from Castor, images flash through Archer&#39;s head of Dr. Walsh, Miller and Tito tied up and gagged on the floor of the Institute as Leo and Lars douse them with jugs of gasoline. One of them then flicks a Zippo lighter and drops it in a puddle of gasoline, starting a fire that burns them alive.Castor then flashes Archer&#39;s wedding ring into Archer&#39;s face, as he casually reveals that he has killed Tito, and has destroyed any evidence that Archer could potentially use to prove who he is. Now he has plans to abuse Archer&#39;s job and even make love to Eve. Archer does not take this well and immediately tries to strangle Castor with his bare hands, but is stopped when guards rush in and restrain him. Castor thanks Walton for saving him, then departs while Archer can only resign himself to his new predicament.Upon returning to the city, Castor immediately heads for his new house. As he is driving through the neighborhood, he looks in utter disbelief at all of the nicely manicured lawns and well-kept houses. He is distracted enough that he &#34;accidentally&#34; overshoots his own house right in front of Eve as she is walking to her car. He backs up to the curb, and smirks as his climbs out of the car. Eve chides Castor for finally forgetting where they lived. Castor insists that she give him a break, as every house looks the same. Eve asks Castor about his &#34;vital assignment&#34;. Castor spaces out for a moment, but finally realizes that this refers to Archer&#39;s current impersonation of him, and gives a lie about an &#34;out-of-body experience&#34; (which in a way is partially true). He can&#39;t help but stare at her butt as she leaves for work at the hospital.Castor goes inside and sits down at a desk in the living room, to settle himself down in his new life. He quickly finds Eve&#39;s diary in a drawer. He is somewhat stunned, upon reading a recent entry, to find that Archer hasn&#39;t had sex with Eve in over two months. Before he can dwell on the matter, he is distracted upon hearing his favorite song &#34;Papa&#39;s Got a Brand New Bag&#34; playing from Jamie&#39;s bedroom. He heads upstairs to find Jamie talking on the phone with her boyfriend while smoking a cigarette in just her underwear and a cropped t-shirt. Castor quips, &#34;Hmm, the plot thickens....&#34; Jamie, angered at Castor&#39;s invasion of her privacy, tries to slam the door on him, but Castor forces his way in, itching for her hidden stash of cigarettes. He narrowly comes close to blowing his cover by calling her &#34;Janie&#34; until he notices her name stitched on her bed pillow and corrects himself. Jamie is confused why her &#34;father&#34; has taken up smoking, to which Castor explains, &#34;You&#39;ll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Papa&#39;s got a brand new bag.&#34; He then slowly backs out of the room while singing along to the music.At Erehwon, Archer tries to come to terms with the reality that Castor has taken over his life. If anything could make him feel worse, it is when he learns that Castor has cut a &#34;deal&#34; with Pollux to turn state&#39;s evidence that also includes immediate release from jail.Pollux is taken to the FBI office, where Castor plays &#34;good cop&#34; by treating him to a gourmet meal. Castor comes into the observation room, where Wanda and Buzz offer him their condolences for Tito&#39;s death. Castor shrugs them off. There is a brief disturbance when Lazarro comes in and confronts Castor to point out that cutting a deal with a lowlife like Pollux is something the real Archer would never do. Castor dismisses him, claiming that he&#39;s trying &#34;fresh tactics&#34;. After everyone else leaves the observation room, Castor switches off the videotape, then enters the interrogation room and turns off the microphone while reminding Pollux that he&#39;s supposed to be snitching. Pollux tells Castor that seeing Archer&#39;s face on him makes him want to cough up his tiramisu. Castor proposes that they can do better if Pollux just &#34;confesses&#34; to the location of the bomb, thinking he will look a lot more impressive and gain media attention that Archer will envy if he single-handedly disarms the bomb.Armed with Castor&#39;s &#34;tip&#34; from Pollux, the police converge on the Convention Center and hurriedly evacuate the building. Inside, Castor watches over two bomb squad technicians trying to disarm the bomb. There is one minute and 15 seconds remaining on the clock. The techs tell Castor that the codes are protected by a tamper switch that will take them several hours to bypass. Castor sternly orders them to leave. Once they are gone, he goes about disarming the bomb in dramatic flair. He bypasses the protective systems, then punches in the disarm code to deactivate the bomb with just two seconds remaining on the clock. Satisfied, he then closes the timer panel.After watching Castor being interviewed on CNN, Archer is shown sulking in his cell, clearly a broken man. At the FBI office, meanwhile, Castor revels in the glory as the other agents congratulate him for disarming the bomb. In contrast to Archer, who is known for usually darkening the mood of his victories by reminding his men of the agents killed in their gunfights, Castor is all smiles, wears his sunglasses indoors, and thanks his men for putting up with him for all the years he was an insufferable bore. Some of the agents, like Archer&#39;s partner Wanda, wonder if Castor just had surgery (which seems to strike a small chord with Castor). He is also more tender and affectionate with Eve than the real Archer is. For instance, when Castor is told by his secretary that the president and his wife are both on the phone trying to contact him, Castor asks her to put the president on hold.Desperate, Archer realizes that the only way he can stop Castor is to break out of prison, so he asks Burke Hicks about the odds of escape during exercise hour. Hicks tells him he can&#39;t escape: he can only get his boots off if he is taken down to the clinic to get shock treatment. Archer immediately notices a guard pulling out a pack of cigarettes and knowing that Castor smokes, he gets an idea. He breaks out of line, walks over to the guard, and demands a cigarette. When the guard orders him to get back in line, Archer punches him, instigating a fight with several other guards, who grab him and drag him away even as he yells to the incited inmates for someone to give him a match.Down in the clinic, Dubov is getting shock therapy in the chair, having apparently picked another fight and failed to heed Walton&#39;s warning following his earlier fight with Archer. When they are done with Dubov, they pull him out of the chair and Archer, being dragged by his shoulders, is put in the chair. He successfully manages to get Walton to light a cigarette for him. As they are securing him, Archer tells Dubov that he didn&#39;t touch Dubov&#39;s wife or sister and knows that they are waiting for him.The guards are about to put the arm restraints on Archer when Dubov suddenly clubs Walton over the back. Several guards hear the raucous and charge Dubov with batons. Dubov swiftly disarms each one of them, and Archer breaks free of the chair. A guard on the catwalk above opens fire with a submachine gun. Archer grabs a pistol and shoots him. Archer then takes cover as another guard appears and opens fire, forcing him into a corner. Dubov takes cover behind a stretcher. The guard fires at Dubov until Archer suddenly shoots him in the foot from below, and he collapses. The elevator doors open on the clinic floor and several guards appear. They open fire on Dubov and continue shooting until he shoves the gurney into them, disarming them.Seeing two more guards coming on the catwalk, Archer grabs a bottle of sulfuric acid from the medical supply cabinet and chucks it upwards. Archer then shoots the bottle in midair, causing a small explosion that knocks one guard off the catwalk and forces the other one to retreat. Archer and Dubov then jump up to the catwalk and start running. The other guard stands up, but Dubov takes the first guard&#39;s submachine gun and shoots him. Archer then climbs up a ladder, scales a wall, and jumps on another guard, tackling him, as a riot breaks out in the exercise hall.In the control room, panic breaks out as Dubov suddenly fires his submachine gun through the door. One guard fires at Archer as he runs along another catwalk, and continues firing until Dubov shoots him from behind. He then begins killing the guards in the control room until Archer arrives and orders him to stop. Archer tells the two remaining guards to leave, then sits down at the computer and starts typing in codes hoping to overload the security system. Before he can start, another guard opens fire on them, sending Archer diving for cover. Dubov fires his submachine gun and offs the guard and one other guard, and continues shooting until a third guard, who had taken cover, stabs him in the leg with a knife.Archer then frantically types codes in to disable the security system, as Dubov whips and overpowers the guard who stabbed him, then tosses him over the railing into the cafeteria. Sparks fly as Archer overloads the TV screen. Just then, a bloodied Walton appears on the cafeteria floor, raises a rifle at Dubov, and fires. Three bullets hit Dubov in his chest. Dubov flails around and falls over the edge. Archer grabs him by the barrel of his gun and tries to pull Dubov back up. However, Dubov is weakened by his wounds. His grip slips and he falls to his death. Walton fires up at Archer, but is stopped when Burke Hicks and a couple other inmates surround him and apparently beat him to death.Now safe, Archer makes his way up a stairway to the roof, only to find that the prison is an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean just off the California shore. Before he can think about how he is out of luck, a helicopter appears. Archer runs and jumps off the edge of the helicopter platform as the gunner opens fire on him. Archer lands on the next deck down, and runs for the edge, only for the helicopter to show up and chase him back across the deck. He lands behind some oil cans. One shot causes a spark that lights Archer&#39;s feet on fire. Archer quickly removes his socks and does a running jump off the platform into the ocean. Archer does not surface and the helicopter pilots presume him deceased.Back at Castor&#39;s house, it is Michael&#39;s birthday. Castor is roped by Eve into going to Michael&#39;s grave. Castor watches Eve place some toys on the angel-shaped tombstone. She breaks down crying in Castor&#39;s arms. Castor appears to be ashamed of himself for his own actions. When Castor returns to his office later that day, he is told by his coworkers that Archer has escaped from prison. Suspicious, he asks to see the body. When he&#39;s told it has not been recovered, Castor realizes that Archer is alive and will be coming for him.After his jailbreak, Archer swims to shore. That night, still in his prison shirt, he steals a car from a valet parking lot, then drives over to the hospital where Eve works. He makes a call from the car phone and tries to warn Eve about Castor. However, his vocal chip causes him to speak with Castor&#39;s natural husky voice, which Eve does not recognize, instead of his real and much more nasally voice. She thinks someone is impersonating her husband and she hangs up on him. Frantic to alert someone he trusts to Castor&#39;s whereabouts, Archer calls the FBI office and asks to be put through to Lazarro, hoping to warn him, but to his dismay, he is transferred by the operator to Castor. Hearing Castor pick up the phone, Archer quickly hangs up and continues driving, switching off a radio report about the police manhunt Castor has declared on him. He then has to lower his head and make a quick right turn when he spots a police car approaching in front of him.Unable to alert any of his colleagues or his wife, Archer decides to drive to the penthouse apartment where Dietrich lives. In the apartment, Dietrich is in the middle of a phone call as he enters his apartment and is stunned, then delighted upon seeing Archer-as-Castor. He invites Archer in and takes him upstairs to the second floor of the apartment, where several of Castor&#39;s old buddies and their girlfriends are hanging out. They all are pleased to see &#34;Castor&#34;.Archer sits down in a chair and Dietrich hands him a box containing some of Castor&#39;s regular contraband: several joints, prescription pills, a box of Chiclets, a money clip, and two gold-plated pistols (identical to the ones Castor was utilizing during the earlier shootout with Archer when they both had their original faces). He takes a moment to pick up the pistols to see how they feel and forces himself to take drug-laced water.Dietrich asks Archer what he plans to do. Archer declares that he&#39;s going to use their help to take down Castor. Castor&#39;s other accomplices point out that &#34;Archer&#34; is a supercop, leading Archer to disclose details about himself, like the fact that his own house security code is the same as Michael&#39;s birthday. To explain how he knows so much about himself, Archer explains that &#34;he&#34; sleeps with Castor&#39;s wife. As to what he plans to do once he abducts Castor, Archer claims he wants to take Castor&#39;s face....off and stick it on himself. Naturally, Castor&#39;s pals think Archer is just spouting pure gibberish.Feeling his body rejecting the drugs, Archer dismisses himself from the conversation and rushes to the bathroom. He tries to rinse his face clean, then he looks in the mirror and immediately draws one of his pistols on the reflection. Archer quickly talks himself out of his panic attack, and is interrupted by the arrival of Sasha. She glowers at him as he turns around, a slasher-style grin frozen on his face. He insists that he is not dead, at which point Sasha slaps him.Meanwhile, Castor is in his living room and in the middle of a heated phone call with Pollux. He reminds Pollux that once he is able to use Archer&#39;s job to get rid of their criminal rivals, he&#39;ll be set and get his old face back. He is interrupted by music, walks over to the window and sees Jamie&#39;s boyfriend Karl (Danny Masterson) pulling up in the driveway with Jamie in tow. As Jamie prepares to get out of the car, Karl attempts to advance on her. She turns him down, however Karl gets more insistent and more forceful in his advances. Seeing the struggle, Castor quickly hangs up the phone on Pollux. Karl has forced himself onto Jamie and is holding her down when Castor suddenly smashes the window with his foot, pulls him out of the car, and then gives him a vicious beating, before slamming his head against the roof and ordering him to apologize. After extracting an apology, Castor throws him aside one last time for good measure.Minutes later, Castor is talking to Jamie about the incident. As they talk, Castor begins to see past the exterior Jamie has put put in front of her family and sees what really is bothering her inside (something the real Archer has failed to notice): she has never come to terms with Michael&#39;s death at Castor&#39;s hands, has outwardly blamed Archer for not doing a better job in protecting their family and has mistrusted him since. As consolation, and not wanting to see Jamie get hurt, he gives her a butterfly knife for &#34;protection&#34;, and instructs her to, if she gets attacked, stab the would-be attacker in the thigh and twist the blade so that the wound won&#39;t be able to close.Back at Dietrich&#39;s penthouse, Archer is shirtless and lying facedown on a bed, with Sasha sitting next to him. He is woken up when Sasha nibbles his shoulder, and mistakenly addresses her as Eve. Realizing she&#39;s not Eve, he bolts awake and instinctively grabs one of his pistols. Sasha takes off Archer&#39;s pants and tries to make advances on him. Archer naturally freaks out. Unbeknownst to either of them, Pollux is standing on a roof across the street watching them through binoculars. Amused to see that Archer is beginning to &#34;enjoy&#34; being his enemy, he phones Castor.Archer is finally able to get Sasha off him and puts on a leather jacket. She tells him to leave, recalling threats Archer made with his original face to put her son Adam up in a foster home. Upon seeing Adam, Archer is surprised to learn that Castor is Adam&#39;s biological father, something the real Castor has never had knowledge of. He immediately begins to regret threatening her, realizing that Sasha is just a single mother struggling to raise Adam to avoid a criminal life.Meanwhile, alerted to Archer&#39;s whereabouts, Castor sends an FBI SWAT team to take up positions on the rooftop across the street and train submachine guns at the windows of the penthouse.Inside, Archer learns that Adam is five years old, almost the same age his own son Michael was when he died, and also learns that Sasha has kept the fact that Adam is Castor&#39;s son a secret, fearing someone would hurt Adam to get to Castor. Sasha encourages Adam to meet his &#34;father&#34;. Archer puts his hand on Adam&#39;s face and immediately has a flashback, recalling running his hand over Michael&#39;s face on a carousel ride just before his death. Seeing so much of Michael in Adam, Archer accidentally blurts his real son&#39;s name while hugging Adam, to Sasha&#39;s confusion. Sasha quickly grabs Adam and pulls him away from Archer, asking Archer what is wrong with him.On cue, an FBI agent across the street fires a grenade launcher. A smoke grenade suddenly crashes through the bedroom window. Archer quickly pulls Sasha and Adam to the ground as the SWAT team opens fire with submachine guns, raking the windows with bullets. The men and women gathered in the loft immediately panic. Dietrich, Aldo and the other thugs quickly grab their weapons.While taking cover behind the bed, Archer quickly grabs Adam&#39;s headset, muffling the shots so that he hears &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; playing instead. While this happens, an officer can be heard on megaphone ordering the inhabitants to surrender.In the living room, a SWAT officer smashes one of the skylights and rappels in, firing a submachine gun. Just before his feet hit the ground, Dietrich raises a shotgun and shoots him. As another agent fires a submachine gun from the roof, Archer grabs Adam and he and Sasha rush into the other room. Another SWAT officer rappels through the side window. One thug covers Archer, Adam and Sasha and fires his pistol to drive the officer back. Some other SWATs burst in through the front doors, but this thug dives to the ground and fires a submachine pistol, forcing them to retreat.Meanwhile, Dietrich uses his shotgun to shoot another SWAT officer on the second floor, sending the officer crashing through the railing. The officer lands on the lower level, dead, just feet from where Archer and Sasha have taken cover. Archer is shocked to see one of his own colleagues die in front of him. Sasha grabs the officer&#39;s submachine gun and she and Archer start to run. As several more of Castor&#39;s men burst in, Archer aims a pistol and yells at them to hold their fire. Surprisingly, the officers comply. Archer and Sasha then dive for cover as the officers fire on Dietrich. Dietrich picks them off with individual shotgun rounds. The other thugs then shoot at the officers in a vicious exchange of gunfire. An officer then rappels through a window near Archer. Archer kicks him back through the window, then when the officer swings back into the apartment, hits him across his visor, knocking him out.Dietrich then yells to Archer to hand him Adam. As Sasha exchanges submachine gun fire with a SWAT officer, Archer hands Adam over to Dietrich, who takes him to the bedroom. The officer Sasha was shooting at is eventually hit several times and falls dead. She then rushes one of the other women up the stairs to safety. Another officer starts to pursue them, but Archer raises a pistol and shoots him in the knee, knocking him down.As Adam rides the shootout out, we see a timelapse montage pass as the thugs and the SWAT officers exchange fire and &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; drowns out shouting and gunfire. Officers and thugs alike are both shot dead in the furious gun battle.The montage ends when Archer grabs Adam from his hiding place just as an officer opens fire on him. Archer hands Adam over to Sasha, who rushes downstairs to the lobby. As she enters the lobby, Archer&#39;s partner Buzz, wearing a balaclava, corners them with a pistol. She promptly kicks him and disarms him. Buzz climbs to his feet and prepares to fire on Sasha, when Archer suddenly collars him, puts a pistol to his head and orders him to drop his weapon. Instinctively, Buzz complies. Archer then spins him around, pulls off his balaclava, and is stunned to recognize him. Before he can explain anything to Buzz, he hears Dietrich approaching. Buzz tries to grab Archer&#39;s pistol, but Archer swiftly disarms him and knocks him unconscious, then shoots the ground next to him just as Dietrich, who has just shot a few more SWAT officers, arrives.Just then, they hear footsteps. Archer has his pistol drawn and sees Castor stealthily walking down a flight of steps. Castor raises his pistol and aims it at Archer. Detecting Sasha moving, he aims his gun in her direction. When he draws a bead on her, Dietrich notices and quickly moves in the way just as Castor fires. The bullet hits Dietrich in the side of his neck. Clutching the wound with his right hand, he tells Sasha to run and exchanges a quick kiss on the cheek before she goes. Archer arrives, but it&#39;s too late to save Dietrich. Dietrich thanks Archer for the good times they had before he collapses and bleeds to death.Archer grabs Dietrich&#39;s submachine gun and heads into the front lobby. He gets a glimpse of Castor running through a back pathway. Archer raises his submachine gun and fires a burst at Castor, shattering several mirrors. There is a moment of silence, then in a mirror, Archer spots Castor running in the opposite direction, spins around, and fires another volley. There is complete silence as Archer drops his submachine gun and trades it for his pistol, while Castor backs up against the opposite side of the mirror panel and quips that he doesn&#39;t know which he hates wearing worse: Archer&#39;s face or his body. He offers to trade their faces back and surrender, but Archer replies &#34;You can&#39;t give back what you&#39;ve taken from me.&#34; Castor then decides to go to Plan B: kill each other.Archer and Castor each train a pistol on their reflection, trained at the other. Both men open fire simultaneously, bullets shattering the glass. Archer suddenly is thrown, a bullet hitting him in the side. The two continue to exchange fire until Loomis arrives with a Commando rifle in hand. Loomis fires on Archer, driving Archer up the stairway and sending Castor diving for cover.Up on the roof, Pollux sees Archer arrive. He climbs up onto a vent, while Archer climbs onto a rope dangling from a crane. As Pollux raises his pistol and prepares to shoot, Archer slams into him, sending Pollux flying before crashing through the skylight. Down below, Castor takes cover as Pollux and lots of glass shards come plummeting towards him. Castor looks up, sees Archer dangling, and fires several rounds, sending Archer fleeing.Castor then looks down and sees Pollux lying on the ground, dead. He immediately breaks down crying. Suddenly Loomis appears, and not knowing that he&#39;s talking to Castor, he asks him why he is shedding tears for the likes of Pollux Troy. Castor snaps with rage, raises his pistol and promptly shoots Loomis in the face. Castor then takes notice of Pollux&#39;s untied shoelaces. In brotherly fashion, he delicately reties Pollux&#39;s shoes and departs.The next morning, Castor returns to his office, dazed. He blows off his secretary as she informs him that he has made TIME Magazine&#39;s &#34;Man of the Year&#34; segment, then sits down in his office chair to brood about Pollux&#39;s death. Seconds later, an agitated Lazarro comes in to inform him that after the unnecessary carnage from his shootout with Archer at Dietrich&#39;s apartment, he&#39;s terminating Castor&#39;s war on crime. Lazarro fails to see a hint of anger suddenly flash across Castor&#39;s face as he queries as to how Castor happens to suddenly know so much about his own men&#39;s movements. Seeing Lazarro clutch his chest from palpitations, Castor stands up, checks to make sure no one in the office is looking, and admits to Lazarro that he&#39;ll give the taxpayers a break, but he has something he wants to confess to Lazarro, something he knows the director won&#39;t like. He promptly snarls into Lazarro&#39;s ear his true identity, then knocks Lazarro to the ground with a cut to the back of the neck. As Lazarro lies on the floor, Castor punches him in the heart hard enough that it stops completely. Collecting himself, Castor calls his secretary to tell her that Lazarro has just suffered a fatal heart attack.Archer, meanwhile, breaks into his own house, narrowly avoiding the police officers that Castor has had placed outside to watch for him, and enters as Eve is coming out of the shower. Eve naturally does not take it easily seeing her husband&#39;s worst enemy&#39;s face, but Archer is able to keep her from making any noise that could attract the attention of the police officers in the house. He explains to her the exact details of the assignment he had been sent away on, how he was given Castor&#39;s face through plastic surgery to get information about one of Castor&#39;s crimes. After telling her what has happened, he admits that while she doesn&#39;t have to believe a word he says, there is one way Eve can validate Archer&#39;s claims: Archer&#39;s blood type is O+ and Castor&#39;s blood type is AB-.When Castor comes home from work that night, he finds Eve working at her computer. He notices that she is looking tense and realizes that Archer has visited her and told her about him. Once Castor is asleep, Eve quietly and stealthily injects a needle into his left arm and draws some of his blood. She then sneaks out of the house and drives over to the hospital. Once there, she puts a couple of blood drops onto a plate and runs it through a hemoglobin test. She gasps as the results come back that say her sample is AB-, meaning she has been sleeping with Castor. Just then, Archer comes into the room, still clutching the bullet wound Castor gave him at Dietrich&#39;s apartment. Eve suddenly draws a revolver on him, saying she doesn&#39;t know who to trust. Archer realizes that she&#39;s holding his backup service weapon. Although Eve still appears skeptical of Archer&#39;s story, once he tells her the story of how they had their first kiss, she eventually realizes the truth. However, once all this is done, Archer promises to make it up to her and Jamie for all the neglect of emotions he put them through.Eve then sets forth on stitching up Archer&#39;s wound in the emergency room. Archer is aware that Lazarro has died, and also knows that the chain of succession means that he technically becomes the new acting director of the Los Angeles field office. As Castor is in Archer&#39;s place, that makes him virtually untouchable. Eve tells him that won&#39;t be the case the next day, as Castor will be at Lazarro&#39;s funeral. Archer tells Eve to get herself and Jamie away from Castor as soon as possible. Eve is not sure, as she can handle an excuse for Jamie, but she&#39;s expected to go to the funeral as well, and if Castor doesn&#39;t see her, he will be suspicious. Almost as if on cue, there is a commotion outside. Aware that Eve has snuck out, Castor has arrived with Leo and Lars and is scouring the hospital looking for Archer. Eve quickly hides Archer as Castor pulls back curtain after curtain looking for his foe. When he pulls back the curtains around Eve, to his disappointment he finds her apparently in the middle of attending to a burn patient. She makes up a story about being on-call for that night. Castor apparently accepts her story and departs with his thugs. Once out of earshot from Eve, Castor quips, &#34;Lies, deceit, mixed messages... this is turning into a real marriage.&#34;The next day, Sasha and Archer track Castor to Lazarro&#39;s funeral, where Castor is holding Archer&#39;s wife and daughter Jamie hostage. Castor reveals that Michael&#39;s death was an accident and he was trying to kill Archer himself. However, he took it personally and advises him to either kill himself or let it go. Archer tells him no father would let go until the one responsible paid for it with his life. Castor replies neither would a brother. Sasha retorts not even a sister and gives Archer (as Castor) the gun. With Eve caught in the middle, everyone is engaged in a Mexican standoff. A gunfight then ensues in which Sasha and all of Castor&#39;s minions are killed. Having taken a bullet to save Archer, Sasha begs him not to let Adam grow up to be a criminal. Archer agrees to keep his promise to her as she dies in his arms and Eve feels sorry for her.Castor and Archer engage in both a gun battle and hand-to-hand fight, with Archer gaining the upper hand. Jamie finds a gun and shoots at Archer (as Castor), believing him to be the real Castor, and wounds him in the shoulder, allowing the real Castor to break free. He takes Jamie as his hostage and licks her face as he mentions peaches. However, she gets him to let her go by stabbing him in the leg with the balisong, ironically a trick which he taught her earlier himself. Eve comforts her as Castor makes his escape by shooting two FBI members as Archer pursues him.Castor manages to escape in a boat, pursued by Archer. After a lengthy chase both Archer and Castor&#39;s boats are destroyed and they are thrown ashore by an explosion resulting from their boats&#39; collisions. The two engage in a final hand-to-hand confrontation which results in Archer eventually prevailing by killing Castor with a spear gun, (which leaves Castor in the same position as the statue shown earlier of Jesus on the cross) but not before Castor tries to destroy Archer&#39;s face (on himself) to prevent Archer reclaiming it.Eve is able to explain the entire situation to the FBI and successfully convince them of Archer&#39;s true identity. Archer is then taken to the hospital where a team of Washington D.C.&#39;s finest doctors does his surgery and his face is restored, with the exception of his chest scar which served as a reminder of the loss of his son as he doesn&#39;t &#34;need it anymore&#34;, due to Castor&#39;s death.After the restoration surgery, Archer (once again played by John Travolta) now wearing his original face and voice, comes home and hugs Eve and Jamie. Jamie apologizes for shooting him, but he tells her that she made the right decison because her bullet actually disloged the vocal microphone that turned his voice into Castor&#39;s. He is proud of the way she stood up to Castor when she stabbed him on his leg. Soon after, he brings Adam Hassler, Castor&#39;s son with Sasha, into his family, in order to fulfill his promise to her in not allowing him to grow up as criminal. Jamie acccepts him as her new brother and shows him to his new room. Eve agrees to adopt him with Sean, knowing that Michael has moved on and Adam can use a new home.

Percy decides to travel on a dangerous quest to retrieve the lightning bolt and save his mother. Grover...                Written by
Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|The movie begins with the camera panning over New York City, past Coney Island and along a pier. Water rises from Brighton Beach and coalesces into the form of a huge being looking like a man-- the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). Poseidon strides through the water along the pier, glancing nonchalantly at a gawking fisherman, and steps onto the streets of New York, shrinking to human size and his garments changing to resemble normal contemporary attire. He arrives at the observation deck of the Empire State building and meets another man there, similarly attired-- his brother Zeus (Sean Bean), king of the Greek gods. Zeus asks Poseidon to look to the sky. Poseidon notes heavy thunderclouds, and Zeus points out there is no lightning-- his master bolt, which gives him control over lightning, has been stolen. Zeus gets directly into Poseidon&#39;s face and tells him that he is convinced that Poseidon&#39;s son is responsible for the theft. Poseidon insists that his son doesn&#39;t know who he is, and warns Zeus about crossing a line, and that if Zeus harms Poseidon&#39;s son, he will be in for the fight of his life, but Zeus does not back down. He tells Poseidon that unless the bolt is returned to him by midnight on June 21st, the summer solstice, there will be war.We then see young teenager Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) sitting calmly at the bottom of a swimming pool. On surfacing, he is told by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) that he had been underwater nearly seven minutes. Hardly possible for most people, Percy thinks little of it. Being under water helps clear his mind and is one of the few places he can think.Percy and Grover are at school at the Yancy Academy, and we see that Grover uses crutches. They walk through the halls, disgusted as several students fight openly in the halls before it is broken up by faculty. In class, there is a substitute teacher, Mrs. Dodds (Maria Olsen), writing a quote from Othello on the blackboard. She asks the class if anyone can explain the quote. Several students raise their hands, but Mrs. Dodds notices Percy glancing away and calls on him. He looks at the blackboard, blinking as the letters seem to twist and dance around confusingly in front of his eyes. Finally he says he doesn&#39;t know the answer.Percy arrives home, kissing his mother, Sally (Catherine Keener), hello. She asks him about school and he is clearly very frustrated. Percy suffers from both dyslexia and ADHD, impairing his school performance. He thought the Yancy Academy was supposed to make things better. Sally tries to assure him that one day, everything will make sense, but he is very dubious.At that moment the door opens and in walks Gabe Ugliano (Joe Pantoliano), Sally&#39;s husband and Percy&#39;s stepfather. Gabe is bald, paunchy, and dirty, with granny glasses attached to a chain around his neck. He sits at the table and asks where his beer is. Sally says it&#39;s in the fridge, but Gabe clearly expects her to bring it to him. Sally complies without a word of complaint, much to Percy&#39;s disgust. He insists that Gabe show some respect to Sally. Gabe gets up and leans against the wall close to Percy, and says that it&#39;s his house and Percy is the one who needs to show some respect.Gabe retreats to his room and Percy asks Sally why she stays with him. Gabe Ugliano is a crass, crude pig of a man with foul armpit stench, who cannot hold a steady job because of his demeanor and smell. Sally tries to insist that Gabe is good to her and Percy in &#39;ways he doesn&#39;t understand.&#39; Percy can only say that Sally is right-- he doesn&#39;t understand.Percy is going with his school class to a museum to look at a gallery of ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. A voiceover from Poseidon tells Percy that everything as he knows it, is about to change. Percy glances around, and Poseidon is seen looking at him across the street, though Percy does not recognize him as he has never seen Poseidon before. A bus moves past Poseidon, in front of him, and he&#39;s gone.At a gallery showing sculptures of the Greek gods, a teacher named Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) is lecturing on them. Mr. Brunner is in a motorized wheelchair, his legs covered in a blanket. Mr. Brunner explains how the gods often came down to Earth and had love affairs-- and sometimes children-- with mortals. He asks Percy if he can tell the class what these children were called. Percy correctly replies, &#39;demigods.&#39; Mr. Brunner says that many of these demigods became great heroes, such as Hercules and Achilles. He then asks Percy to name another, giving him a hint: he has something in common with this hero.Percy happens to glance up at a wall mural above Mr. Brunner&#39;s head. The Ancient Greek writing seems to dance and twist around before Percy&#39;s eyes, and to his surprise, he can read it: Perseus. Percy realizes that his own name is similar to Perseus.As Mr. Brunner begins to explain the labors of Hercules and his victory over the Nemean lion, Mrs. Dodds quietly asks if she can speak to Percy alone, away from the other students. She opens a door into an adjacent, unfinished room, and enters behind Percy. But when he turns around, she is standing high up on a scaffolding.In a harsh, grating voice, Mrs. Dodds demands, &#34;Where is it?&#34; Percy is completely confused, and then confounded as Mrs. Dodds changes into a hideous winged beast with long fangs that swoops down and demands that Percy give her the lightning bolt he stole. Percy is horrified and with no idea as to what is going on. The creature swoops again and seizes Percy, lifting him high up in the air and threatening to bite his heart out unless he returns the stolen lightning bolt.Grover and Mr. Brunner burst into the room, The creature turns, recognizing Mr. Brunner, who demands that it release Percy or he&#39;ll tear the creature to pieces. The winged monster drops Percy and crashes through the window, flying off.Percy is sick with disbelief at what happened-- and then even more so as Mr. Brunner turns to Grover and curses himself for not having realized that a &#34;Fury&#34; was concealed in their school. He asks Percy what the Fury wanted from him, and he shrugs and says that she said something about him stealing a lightning bolt. Mr. Brunner says in a very worried tone, &#34;they found him,&#34; and Grover looks horrified, confusing Percy even further. Mr. Brunner tells Grover that Percy is no longer safe, and they should move him to &#34;the camp.&#34; Percy confronts them on talking about him, right in front of him, without talking TO him. Mr. Brunner only hands Percy an object, telling him it is a powerful weapon and he should guard it well. Percy stares in amazement at what, to him, appears to be an ordinary writing pen. Mr. Brunner instructs Grover to bring Percy to Sally and not to take his eyes off of him. Grover nods and urges Percy to come with him. Neither Grover nor Mr. Brunner offer Percy any further answers, so for now he goes with Grover.Hurrying down the street, Grover warns Percy to simply keep walking and not to look at anyone. Percy demands to know why Mr. Brunner wanted Grover to watch Percy, and Grover only says that he is Percy&#39;s protector. He insists he is quite capable of doing this despite apparently being on crutches.At Percy&#39;s house, Gabe is playing poker with friends while Sally waits on them uncomplainingly. Percy comes in with Grover and urgently tells Sally they need to talk. Gabe crudely tells Percy to beat it, and Percy calls him a bald-headed freak. Gabe jumps up to hit Percy, but Grover slams a crutch down onto his foot and then hits him in the groin with it, which impresses Percy. Grover tells Sally that Percy has to leave immediately. Sally acquiesces and hurries out of the house with him.Driving across a bridge, Sally is no more straight with Percy than Grover or Mr. Brunner had been. She only tells him that she&#39;s bringing them to a &#34;camp for really special people.&#34; She says it&#39;s about Percy&#39;s father-- his true father.As they drive on, Sally starts to tell Percy about how she met Percy&#39;s father... a man she never addresses by name. She says she was truly in love with him, and he loved her and Percy in turn. She admits that Percy&#39;s father left, but insists that he was forced to do it, and didn&#39;t abandon either of them.As they drive past a field with cows, one horned head rises up, looking much larger than the other cows&#39; heads. Grover suddenly shouts urgently for Sally to watch out. She gapes in horror as the corpse of a cow is suddenly thrown into the road right in front of them. Sally loses control of the car and it flips over.The sound of heavy, ponderous footsteps begin to approach them. Percy stares as Grover removes his pants, revealing that his legs are those of a goat, complete with hooves. Grover uses them to smash through the car windshield so they can all get ouf of the car. The crutches, as he hurriedly says, are &#34;just for show--&#34; Grover can walk and run perfectly well, without them. The three of them flee from the approaching horror-- a huge bull-like humanoid. The monster picks up the car and hurls it at them.They arrive at a stone arch surrounded by torches, which Grover says is their destination. As Percy stares up at the arch, Greek lettering dances around before his eyes to form recognizable words: &#34;Camp Half Blood.&#34; He and Grover dash through the arch... but Sally is unable to pass through; some kind of barrier repels her. She urgently tells Percy that she cannot pass through the gate because she is &#34;not like him.&#34; Percy refuses to leave without her but Sally begs him to do so. Just then, the huge minotaur grabs Sally from behind, and Percy watches in horror as the monster holds her aloft in one hand. She begs him to run, saying he&#39;s safe inside the gate, but Percy insists on facing the monster down. Grover shouts for him to take out the pen Mr. Brunner gave him, and click it. Percy does so and is shocked to see it transform into a Greek sword. The minotaur squeezes Sally and she screams briefly before disappearing in a flash of smoke and gold-colored dust.Enraged, Percy charges at the minotaur, swinging the sword. The minotaur dodges and hurls a punch that blasts Percy into a tree. It charges at him on all fours, and he jumps away. One of the minotaur&#39;s horns lodges in the tree, and part of the horn breaks off when it tries to pull it loose. Percy grabs the broken-off horn as the minotaur charges again, and drives it into the monster&#39;s middle, killing it. Percy faints and collapses into Grover&#39;s arms.He awakens lying in a cot with Grover watching over him. Grover is now clad in a leather vest with a dagger sheathed at his hip. He tells Percy that he is in the camp infirmary and has been unconscious for three days. He asks what Percy remembers. Percy thinks he awoke from a crazy dream, but then glances down and sees Grover&#39;s goat-legs and hooves. Grover says that he is a satyr. Percy breaks down in misery realizing everything was real, and his mother is gone. Grover tries to comfort him, saying he feels responsible as it&#39;s his job to protect Percy, although he is just a junior protector and doesn&#39;t have his horns yet.Grover begins to take Percy around Camp Half Blood. People are seen in a mixture of modern and ancient Greek attire, and are training in combat with Greek weapons-- swords, shields, and bows. Grover finally begins to explain the truth about Percy, much to his continuing disbelief-- Percy is a demigod; one of hundreds throughout the world. Camp Half Blood is where demigods learn to harness their abilities, and while many go to lead &#34;normal lives,&#34; many go on to become great leaders and heroes, though Percy cannot see himself as a hero. Grover then explains Percy&#39;s dyslexia and ADHD-- written letters and words seem to twist and dance around before his eyes because his brain is hardwired to read ancient Greek, not modern English; like back at the museum when he was able to read the Greek writing. And his ADHD is his divine battle reflexes. He was never able to be still, and this is what allowed him to survive-- and prevail, in his battle with the minotaur. As Grover says, no &#34;loser&#34; (as Percy thinks of himself) can defeat one.Grover brings Percy to a field along a river where the students do most of their battle training. Percy stops and watches a beautiful young woman with long brunette hair battling several students at once-- and winning handily. She wields her sword with a grace and agility that Percy thinks he can only dream of. Percy asks Grover who she is, and he just laughs and warns him that the girl could tear him apart. But he says the girl&#39;s name is Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), and she is the daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom. Still holding her sword at the throat of her last opponent, Annabeth happens to look in their direction, her expression unreadable as she look at Percy, almost as if recognizing him.Grover leads Percy to another field where he sees another amazing sight-- several centaurs engaged in a running exercise. But what&#39;s even more amazing is the lead centaur-- Mr. Brunner, or as he explains, here in this world, he is the legendary teacher, Chiron. He apologizes for hiding his true form, but he needed to keep an eye on Percy.As they continue through the camp, Grover is called to by a group of daughters of Aphrodite, goddess of love. Chiron smirks as Grover goes to join them, suggesting to Percy that he knows where it will lead. Chiron brings Percy into a house which he says is Percy&#39;s quarters at the camp. The house is filled with nautical objects, and includes a heavy trident. Picking up the trident, looking at it, Percy realizes that some of the walls are carved with a symbol resembling the trident. Understanding dawns on him-- Percy is the son of Poseidon, god of the sea. Chiron says this has been kept from Percy for all these years for his own safety-- for a child to be sired by one of the &#34;big three&#34; Greek gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) is exceptionally rare, and as the son of Poseidon, Percy is one of the most powerful of the demigods, which makes him a threat to the Olympian gods. Chiron then explains that Sally knew all of this, and the reason she married Ugliano was that his foul armpit stench hid and masked the smell of Percy&#39;s blood from anything that the gods could have sent to eliminate him. Percy is quiet and thoughtful as he realizes how much Sally sacrificed for him-- why she tolerated Gabe&#39;s treatment of her so gracefully.Chiron then finally tells Percy about the reference to him as &#34;the lightning thief--&#34; Zeus&#39; lightning bolt is the most powerful weapon ever created. Zeus&#39; belief that Percy stole it centers aorund a very valid worry that it could pose a threat to Zeus&#39; station as ruler of all the gods. Chiron warns Percy in a dire tone, that in ten days, if the bolt is not returned, the resulting war between Zeus and Poseidon would force all of Olympus to choose sides, and Earth would be torn asunder. Chiron plans to bring Percy to Olympus and make an appeal directly to Zeus as to Percy&#39;s innocence. As to why they can&#39;t go right now-- outside the gates are dangers; the Fury and the Minotaur being only the beginning. First, Percy needs to train so he will be able to handle these dangers.Grover and Percy are heading to the training field; Percy suited up properly in leather and mail armor and feeling very awkward in it. Chiron orders all the students to fall in and gather around him. He introduces Percy to all the other students and says he will need a team. Stepping forth to volunteer to take him, is Luke (Jake Abel), son of Hermes and camp leader. Luke is a bit cocky and a bit of a jokester but takes to Percy right off. He gives Percy a helmet and welcomes him to his team-- the Blue soldiers. Chiron then orders all the students to prepare for game of Capture the Flag-- Ancient Greek style.The two armies rush forth on command, swords and shields clashing. Luke tells Percy that he knows where the enemy flag is and to follow him. Ambushed by several Sons of Ares fighting for the red team, Luke and Percy fend them off, Percy amazed at having knocked out two of them. Luke urges Percy to hurry to the red flag while he holds off the rest of the Sons of Ares.Percy hurries to a stream, where he removes his helmet and kneels to take a drink. But before he sips the water, he looks up and sees the red flag, completely unguarded, just across the stream. Grabbing his sword, he rushes in delight over to the banner.But one red soldier is there to meet him-- Annabeth. The daughter of Athena quickly deals Percy several slash wounds and knocks him about the stream bank, seemingly toying with him. Chiron, Grover, Luke and a number of soldiers from both teams find their way there. Annabeth slashes Percy again and again, and kicks him down to the ground. The red soldiers cheer and gloat as she walks back to them.Suddenly Percy hears his father&#39;s voice telling him to go to the water, and it will give him power. Slowly, painfully, he crawls to the stream. Everyone turns and looks as he dips his hand into the water. Curiosity turns to surprise and then shock as the water flows up his arm and shoulder, and over his whole body, healing all his wounds. Percy climbs to his feet, surging with new power and strength, and makes a beeline for Annabeth, easily swatting aside all Red soldiers that try to stop him. Quickly the tip of his sword is at her throat, and she looks at him in amazement. Regaining her focus, Annabeth bats Percy&#39;s sword aside and they fight once again. But this time Percy matches her, strike for strike, parry for parry. They grapple at close quarters and Percy wrests her sword from her grip, putting its blade to the back of her neck, and the point of his own sword to her throat as Grover and Chiron clap excitedly.Annabeth surrenders, looking at Percy with a mixture of surprise at her defeat and admiration for the power he wields. He returns her sword and marches to the red flag. Nobody stands in his way as he plants his sword in the stream bank and lifts the red flag up high over his head in victory, the blue soldiers all cheering and applauding.In the evening at dinner, Percy is approached by several nymphs inviting him to a party at their quarters. As he fills his cup, Annabeth comes up to fills hers, and they talk. Annabeth explains to Percy that her mother and his father have been long time enemies for many centuries. She says she has strong feelings for Percy, but hasn&#39;t decided if they&#39;re amicable or hostile yet.The dinner feast is interrupted by the arrival of a massive, terrible winged demon appearing through a bonfire-- Hades. Hades calls Percy out and tells him that Sally is alive and well, but she is his prisoner, and he will release her to Percy only if he brings Hades the lightning bolt.After Hades vanishes, Percy wants to travel to the underworld to negotiate Sally&#39;s release, thinking Hades will have no reason to hold her once Percy explains he didn&#39;t steal the ilghtning bolt and doesn&#39;t have it. But Chiron warns him that Hades doesn&#39;t work that way, and will kill both him and Sally. He insists that Percy stick to the original plan of appealing directly to Zeus first, and then they can formulate plans to rescue Sally.Later that night, Grover finds Percy preparing to leave camp to set out for the Underworld, determined to rescue his mother. When Grover finds he cannot dissuade Percy, he insists on coming along, this being his job as Percy&#39;s protector. Annabeth also wants to come along. She&#39;s trained many years at the camp, but that&#39;s all she&#39;s done-- she&#39;s never embarked on an actual quest and hardly gotten to see the outside world. In addition, she&#39;s won a great many more battles than Percy, so her experience will come in handy. Percy is reluctant at first but then assents to their going with him.The first puzzle is reaching the underworld... none of them knows how to get there. But Annabeth believes she knows who would.The three of them visit Luke at his quarters, finding him playing video games. Luke&#39;s quarters are decked out with a lot of amenities from the modern world, including electronics, which he prefers over the &#34;Renaissance Fair&#34; decor of the camp. Annabeth knows that Luke&#39;s father, Hermes, as the messenger of the gods, has traveled to the underworld many times, and she asks if he knows anything about how to get there. Luke says he doesn&#39;t speak to his father and doesn&#39;t at all care for him (&#39;we all have daddy issues,&#39; he explains), but he says he broke into his father&#39;s house once and has some things that may help them. One is a pair of flying winged shoes, one of hundreds of pairs Hermes owns and uses to travel. Another is a map that will help locate three of the Pearls of Persephone. Luke explains that Persephone is more a prisoner of Hades than his wife, and she is miserable there. For comfort and companionship, she has many paramours and lovers. She gives them the pearls as a means of leaving the underworld unnoticed by Hades-- one needs only to crush a pearl underfoot and concentrate on where to go.The map will help them find three of the pearls that are hidden in the United States. It shows one pearl located in a Garden Emporium owned by someone named Auntie Em, and located in Leeds Point, New Jersey. When the pearl is found, the map will show the location of the next one. When all three pearls are collected, the map will show where they can find a secret entrance to the underworld.As a final gift, Luke asks Percy to take his favorite shield, saying it will be of help to him.Percy, Grover and Annabeth catch a bus and make their way to Auntie Em&#39;s garden Emporium. They find it seemingly unoccupied and nearly delapidated; what appears to be an icebox with free soft drinks only contains a nest of rats. There are a lot of stone statues around. Annabeth notices a stone fountain with a number of Greek gold drachmas, meaning they&#39;re on the right track. She gives them to Percy. The three decide to split up and search the whole Emporium, hoping to find the pearl.Annabeth walks past more statues, eerily carved as if cowering in terror from whatever they are pointed to face. Suddenly a strange, middle-aged woman rushes up out of nowhere, hysterically begging for her help. Barely coherent, she only manages to get out that she and her husband stopped for directions. She grabs Annabeth&#39;s forearm, hysterically begging for Annabeth to come and help her.Grover finds his way to a shed where one of the statues is of a satyr, which strongly resembles his uncle Ferdinand. In fact, it&#39;s a near perfect stone replica of him, right down to the mole on his forehead. Grover muses, deciding it can&#39;t be his actual uncle, because he was killed by...Grover freezes in horror. His uncle was killed when he was turned to stone by Medusa. Auntie *EM&#39;s* Emporium... M for Medusa. Frantically he rushes to find Annabeth and Percy. Percy hears Grover&#39;s frantic yells that they are all in trouble. He grabs his pen and activates it as his sword and rushes to rendezvous with him. Meanwhile, Annabeth is still being pulled by her wrist, by the hysterical woman, who is screaming that they have to leave before &#34;she&#34; finds them... a woman who turned her husband to stone.The scene switches back and forth a few times between Percy and Grover, running through the Emporium grounds trying to find each other... and find each other they do, literally running smack into each other. Grover tells Percy that they&#39;re in Medusa&#39;s lair. They still need to find Annabeth.Annabeth is still being pulled along by the hysterical woman, who realizes she is lost on the Emporium grounds and is terrified they&#39;ll never get out alive. Suddenly they stop short, Annabeth saying not to move. Standing right in front of them, a turban-like cloth wrap over her head and dark shades over her eyes, is Medusa (Uma Thurman).Medusa speaks slowly and seductively, telling how she creates her &#39;statues&#39; which serve as her only company in such a &#39;lonely&#39; place. Suddenly she addresses Annabeth as &#39;daughter of Athena,&#39; showing Medusa recognizes her for who she is. Medusa explains that she once had the same beautiful brown hair as Annabeth. Toying with a few locks of Annabeth&#39;s hair, Medusa explains that she was desired and courted by many suitors, which made Athena jealous, and led her to curse Medusa.Medusa steps back and removes her headpiece, revealing the snakes that serve as her hair, as Annabeth urges the hysterical woman not to look. Both of them snap their eyes shut as Medusa&#39;s tone turns stern, saying that eyes are the windows to the soul, and she hopes they find hers attractive. She removes her dark shades, revealing her terrible blue eyes with the power to turn people to stone. Her tone turning seductive again, she gently whispers for them to &#39;sneak a peek&#39; at her eyes.The lure proves too much for the hysterical woman, who looks at Medusa&#39;s eyes and promptly turns to stone; her now-stone hand still locked around Annabeth&#39;s wrist.Percy and Grover arrive, behind Medusa, and she isn&#39;t yet aware of their presence. Percy knows that they can look at her reflection safely, and takes out his iPhone. Grover says he&#39;ll get Annabeth away.Medusa cockily puts her sunglasses on the hysterical woman&#39;s left wrist and gets very close to Annabeth, taunting her that she will eventually open her eyes. Medusa gets close enough that her hair-snakes flick through Annabeth&#39;s hair and across her cheeks. Annabeth trembles in fear, desperately fighting to keep her eyes tightly shut.Hearing Medusa speak, Percy calls out, trying to give Annabeth resolve to keep her eyes closed. Medusa hears Percy&#39;s voice and whirls around, realizing that the new arrival is another demigod. She heads toward the sound of where Percy&#39;s voice came from. Percy runs, leading Medusa away from Annabeth, using the reflection in his iPhone to keep track of Medusa. As Percy pauses behind a statue, Medusa stops, recognizing Percy by the smell of his blood as the son of Poseidon. She remarks that she used to date Poseidon before pushing one statue down, causing it to topple a line of statues like dominoes; the last one landing on Percy.Annabeth struggles futilely to free her wrist from the now-stone woman&#39;s grasp, still not daring to open her eyes. Grover comes up and uses a crutch to smash the woman&#39;s arm off, freeing Annabeth. The two rush to rendezvous with Percy.Trying to crawl out from under the statue, Percy reaches for his sword, but Medusa kicks it away and lifts Percy by the scruff of his neck. Percy jams his eyes shut as Medusa holds him close to her face and tells him that she hears he has the stolen lightning bolt. She leans her head in close and tells Percy that her &#39;hungry babies&#39; can open Percy&#39;s eyes for him if he doesn&#39;t do it himself. She sweetly says that he can stay with her always; all he has to do is look.Medusa&#39;s soft and seductive whisper almost has Percy about to open his eyes when Grover and Annabeth arrive on the scene, driving the pickup truck owned by the hysterical woman and her husband (they don&#39;t need it anymore). They smash through several statues, knocking Medusa down.Medusa hisses angrily, looking about for Percy. She finds his iPhone and peers curiously at it. Distracted, she doesn&#39;t hear Percy coming up behind her. She spots his reflection in the iPhone too late-- Percy beheads her with a swift stroke of his sword.Grover and Annabeth exit the truck, tapping fists in celebration of vanquishing Medusa. Though Grover is repulsed at the idea, Annabeth says they need to take Medusa&#39;s severed head with them. If they open her eyes, their power to turn living beings to stone still works. Percy asks Grover for his jacket so they can wrap up the head. Grover gives Percy his hoodie instead.After giving the head to Grover, Percy happens to look again at Medusa&#39;s headless body and realizes that she is wearing a bracelet with the pearl set into it. He pries it free and the three of them drive off in the pickup truck.As they head down the road, Annabeth wonders why Luke didn&#39;t warn them about Medusa (why indeed....) Grover asks Percy to open up the map so it will show them where the next pearl is. The map reveals the location as a replica of the Greek Parthenon... in Nashville, Tennessee (much to Grover&#39;s disgust; he hates country music).It is late at night and they are still on the road. Percy and Annabeth are fast asleep, and Grover starts to nod off at the wheel. The blare of an eighteen-wheeler&#39;s horn jolts them all awake and Grover barely swerves away. The three of them, shaken, decide to stop for the night. They make their way to a roadside motor inn and get a room.Just before sunrise, Percy is in the swimming pool, sitting on the pool floor as he loves to do. An image of his mother, and Hades holding her prisoner, flashes through his mind. He looks up and notices Annabeth standing at the poolside, watching him. He surfaces and she sits down, her feet in the water. Percy notices the bruises on Annabeth&#39;s wrist from the woman who was turned to stone by Medusa. Gently taking her arm, he heals the bruises for her through his connection to the water. He climbs up and sits beside her at the poolside and asks why Poseidon and Athena are enemies. She explains it started when they vied for patronage of Athens and the people of the city chose Athena. Percy asks what Athena is like, but Annabeth doesn&#39;t know-- like Percy and Luke, she&#39;s never met her divine parent. Percy is surprised, wondering if any demigod has ever met their divine parent. Annabeth explains that this is forbidden by Zeus himself... he decreed that all gods were prohibited from having any physical contact with their half-mortal children. Both agree that the law is ridiculous, though Annabeth tells Percy that she believes she hears her mother speaking to her in her mind in times of trouble, giving her advice. Percy realizes that&#39;s the same as the voice he hears in his head, and Annabeth says that&#39;s Poseidon talking to him.An urgent shout from Grover recalls them to their room. A news article on TV has listed Percy as a missing person... and a suspect in the disappearance of Sally. To Percy&#39;s revulsion, Gabe Ugliano is interviewed in the news segment, spouting lies about Percy having been on drugs and alcohol; and five nights ago, Percy tried to kill him and threw Sally on the ground, before Percy&#39;s &#39;cripple friend&#39; attacked Gabe from behind (Grover gapes in astonishment at the preposterous story), and Percy kidnapped Sally and took her away. Percy shuts off the TV in disgust, figuring he is now a fugitive.Grover goes to the bathroom to pee and groans as he sees that Percy placed Medusa&#39;s head there. He holds it up and admonishes Percy for putting it there. A maid working at the motor inn passes by the window and sees, and screams as she rushes away. Grover curses himself for having left the curtains open. Annabeth realizes they have to leave right away.They arrive in Nashville at daytime. making their way to Centennial Park where the replica of the Parthenon is located. Inside, they stand before a huge statue of a Greek warrior woman. Percy is able to read the Ancient Greek on the nameplate and sees it is a statue of Annabeth&#39;s mother, Athena. Annabeth gazes up at the statue, wondering if her mother really looks the way she is depicted, and she smiles when Percy assures her that they&#39;ll find out. Grover looks up at a golden headdress set on the statue&#39;s head and notes that the pearl is set into the centerpiece of it.This presents a problem-- how to get up 30 feet in the air, especially while the place is filled with tourists. Percy has an idea to the solution. The three of them hide in bathroom stalls, standing on them so their legs and feet aren&#39;t seen, and wait for the place to close for the night. An hour after the park closes they come out, with the plan being for Percy to use the flying shoes to get up to the head of the statue. But although the park is closed, the Parthenon isn&#39;t quite empty... night custodians are there, cleaning the place. Annabeth loads a hand crossbow and darts between pillars, stealthily and quickly taking the custodians out with drugged darts. Grover drags the sleeping custodians to one side of the Parthenon as Annabeth sets up her wireless laptop and makes a conference call to Luke, to get instructions on activating the flying shoes. Luke quickly explains that Percy needs to get a running start and build up speed, and that it will take some practice. But Percy proves more adept than this, and although he nearly loses his grip on the statue, he is able to climb back up the pry the pearl out from the headdress. Guided by the shoes to an easy landing on the ground, they all tap fists and Annabeth hugs Percy, telling everyone to gather up their things.But they&#39;re not out of the woods yet... the custodians have recovered and form a line in front of the exit. Grover tries to bluff them by acting like he&#39;s a Park Recreational Services manager. But it quickly becomes apparent that these custodians are not ordinary people. They address Percy by name and demand the return of the lightning bolt. Percy sighs in exasperation, but his protest that he doesn&#39;t have it falls on deaf ears. One custodian coughs a puff of fire, and then all five of them merge into a giant monster... the five-headed hydra. Percy, Annabeth and Grover rush behind pillars as the middle head spews a cone of roaring flames. Percy&#39;s jacket is ignited, and when he shakes his arm to quell the flames, he loses his grip on the pearl, which flies across the Parthenon, resting on top of a flood drain grille. Activating his sword and shield, Percy takes to the air, and despite Annabeth&#39;s urgent warnings, he begins slicing off the heads of the hydra.The hydra collapses as the last head is severed, and Percy and Grover start to high-five. But Annabeth admonishes them that Percy only made the problem worse. She&#39;s the only one of the three that remembers that when one head of the hydra is cut off, two more grow back in its place.A terrible roar and the ground shaking prove the point of Annabeth&#39;s admonishment as the hydra rises again... now with ten heads; two of which spout flame. Percy tells Annabeth to distract it while he retrieves the pearl. Annabeth draws her bow, loosing several arrows to harass the hydra. But although one head is hit squarely in the eye, the hydra still turns as Percy dashes for the pearl, and the two central heads spew gouts of fire. Percy dives away, using his shield to protect himself, but the shield is thrown from his grasp several yards away. As the hydra closes in, Percy notices emergency fire hoses. Reaching out and concetrating, Percy summons the water from its holding tanks to form a wall between himself and the hydra. The wall of water also acts as a shield against the hydra&#39;s flaming breath, and allows Percy to retrieve the pearl. He dashes for the door, Grover and Annabeth right behind him... but they realize the hydra will reach them before they can get the door open. Grover gets an idea and rushes back toward the hydra, grabbing Percy&#39;s backpack. He grabs the head of Medusa, and snapping his eyes shut, points the face at the hydra and removes the shades from Medusa&#39;s eyes. Quickly the eyes begin to flash and the snake heads begin to thrash about. The flames stop short of the head and the hydra turns to stone.The three adventurers make their way to an all night diner to eat. During the meal, they see a special news bulletin on the TV where scientsts are at a loss to understand a single storm cloud that has grown so massive as to spread over much of Europe and Asia. The cloud is expanding westward toward the United States, and much of the world&#39;s coastlines are experiencing gale-force winds and massive surf waves. Annabeth realizes the gods are angry, and they need to get the last pearl quickly. They examine the map and find that it is in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Lotus Hotel and Casino.As they approach the casino, they need to fight to remind themselves that they&#39;re only there for the pearl, not for any form of entertainment. Right away a casino employee tries to make them accept a casino fun book, and they have to assert themselves that they aren&#39;t checking in. Grover figures that since the cocktail waitresses are all wearing green dresses, perhaps one of them has the pearl.Several waitresses quickly surround them, holding trays filled with cookies that they call Lotus Flowers-- the casino&#39;s signature dish. Tentatively, the three of them each try a sample. They find the cookies exquisitely delicious... not even noticing the psychedelic effect the &#39;lotus flowers&#39; have on them. They start to laugh and giggle in growing excitement as they continue to look around them. In half a minute they&#39;ve forgotten what they&#39;re there for, except to have fun and enjoy themselves. The decision to stay-- perhaps as permanent fixtures of the casino-- is a no-brainer.Percy, Annabeth and Grover all start to partake in the casino&#39;s festivities-- gambling, dancing, partying... and of course more of the delicious lotus flowers. But finally, just as Percy is about to eat one, he hears his father&#39;s voice admonishing him not to. The flowers dull their senses and keep them prisoner in the casino. Crinkling his brow, he excuses himself from Annabeth to walk around, and leaves the lotus flower uneaten on the bar. He begins to walk through a video arcade, declining all the waitresses who swarm around with their flower trays. Poseidon&#39;s voice guides him, telling him to focus. He passes a young man playing a pinball machine themed after the movie, The French Connection (1971). The young man asks if Percy&#39;s seen it, and Percy is stunned when the young man doesn&#39;t understand him when he says he&#39;s seen it on DVD. Quickly he realizes that the young man thinks that the year is still 1971; the year the movie was first released. Percy starts to snap out of it, guided by Poseidon&#39;s voice. He realizes the cocktail waitresses are redoubling their efforts to serve him more lotus flowers and starts to understand the entrapment effect of them. Then he walks past a roulette table and sees that the roulette ball is the pearl he came for. This jolts him completely back to his senses. As he walks away from another waitress trying to make him have another lotus flower, a bellhop turns and speaks into a headphone: &#39;Percy Jackson&#39;s awake.&#39;Percy hurries back to Annabeth, finding her dancing with several young women. He grabs her and herds her to where Grover is being tended to by a group of gorgeous young women. Pulling a satyr away from beautiful women is hard enough when Grover is sober, but Percy manages to do it. Raising his voice to an urgent pitch, he finally gets through to them that the lotus flowers are putting them in a trance and making them want to stay and party. The sight of security guards converging on them helps break the trance on Annabeth and Grover. Together with Percy they must now fight their way through the guards back to the roulette table where Percy grabs the pearl. Rushing to a car on display as a prize that can be won, they use it to escape from the casino.Racing down the street until they feel a safe distance away, they recollect their thoughts. Annabeth realizes the casino is the lair of the Lotus Eaters-- and the &#39;casino&#39; is where they have trapped people since ancient times. Even more dire is Grover passing a large display LCD calendar sign... the date is no longer June 15th, but June 20th... they&#39;d spent five days and nights in the Lotus Casino&#39;s trap. The deadline being only a day away, they consult the map, finding the entrance to Hades is in Hollywood. Grover nods grimly, saying he can get them there in four hours.As they pull up before the famous Hollywood hillside sign, the radio gives a news report that the storm clouds have covered most of North America. Several states are ordering evacuations as the weather grows more severe. They run along the sign&#39;s letters, pausing as Percy notes that some of the graffiti appears to be written in Ancient Greek. Quickly he reads it: &#39;Woe to all depraved souls.&#39;Quickly a patch of ground beside the letter opens up, revealing an entryway deep underground... which closes up behind them as they walk in.They make their way down a subterranean tunnel with torches and lots of skulls in the earthen walls. Presently they come to a mysterious man in a long hooded robe, standing in a canoe float in a dark river beside the platform. Approaching him, they see he is the ferryman who brings souls to Hades&#39; kingdom. The ferryman refuses to bring them to Hades because they are still living. He tells them to come back when they are properly dead. Grover tries to bribe the ferryman with several bills of American currency. But, looking at them curiously, the ferryman burns them to ash in his hand, letting the ashes fall through his fingers.Percy realizes Grover was on the right track but used the wrong kind of currency. He gives the ferryman the gold drachmas taken from the fountain in Medusa&#39;s lair. This, the ferryman accepts, and takes them across the legendary River Styx, which is filled with centuries of broken human dreams and sorrows; wishes and hopes that never came true.Percy, Grover and Annabeth walk into the entrance to Hades&#39; palace. They are promptly greeted by three hellhounds that guard their master&#39;s domain. THe hounds are called off by Persephone (Rosario Dawson) who brings them to Hades. The three adventurers are surprised to see that Hades has taken on human form as well (played by Steve Coogan). Hades reveals he is seeking Zeus&#39; lightning bolt because it would allow him to overthrow his brothers and escape from the underworld, where he was exiled by Zeus. If Zeus and Poseidon destroyed each other in a war, he would be able to take over Olympus.Percy tries to explain that he doesn&#39;t have the lightning bolt, but Hades doesn&#39;t believe him. He picks up an orb and shatters it on the ground, revealing that this was where he had been keeping Sally imprisoned. Percy rushes forth to hug Sally, grateful that she is alive and well.But slowly everyone starts to become aware of Hades staring intently at Luke&#39;s shield, which Percy had dropped to the ground in order to hug his mother. The handgrip of the shield has opened up after being dropped, to reveal a secret compartment inside it. Inside this compartment is the missing lightning bolt.Percy, Grover and Annabeth realize that Luke was behind the theft of the lightning bolt all along, but none of that matters to Hades. He only cares that he has what he wanted. Picking up the bolt, he breaks his word to Percy and orders Persephone to feed Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Sally to &#39;the souls.&#39;Persephone gestures and a grille over what looks like a fireplace, opens up... but behind this grille is no mere fireplace, but a furnace of damned, burning souls that start to writhe outward, smelling the living souls they are about to receive. Persephone then calls the hellhounds to herd the three adventurers toward the flames. Hades gloats with wicked glee at how he will rule the gods. Persephone grins wickedly and grabs her husband for an amorous smooch.Or not so amorous, as while Hades is distracted, Persephone snatches the lightning bolt out of his hands and zaps him with it, knocking him unconscious. Quickly she calls off the hellhounds and closes the furnace gate. Kneeling over Hades, Persephone gloats at how he will remember nothing of all these recent events when he wakes up. Although grateful, Percy is curious as to why Persephone is helping them. She explains that Hades treats her like dirt, and all she has to look forward to while in his domain, is her alotted time back on Olympus. A war of the gods would destroy all that, and leave her alone with only Hades for company-- the worst kind of company she could dread havinag to keep. She gives Percy the lightning bolt and tells him to take it, and Sally, away.But as Percy takes out the pearls, it quickly becomes evident that there is a problem. There are three pearls, and three members of Percy&#39;s party (himself, Grover and Annabeth)... but Sally makes a fourth person, and each pearl only grants egress to one. This means one of them has to stay behind in the underworld. There is a brief argument between Percy and Annabeth, both of whom feel they should be the one to stay... until Grover says that as Percy&#39;s protector, it&#39;s his duty and job to take on the burden. Persephone is delighted at this and promises to &#34;take very good care&#34; of Grover.Percy, Annabeth and Sally use the pearls to take them to Olympus, but Percy is confused when they arrive at the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Annabeth points out the terrible storm clouds above-- Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle. Sally assures Percy that they are in the right place and shows him an entrance to a service closet that contains the secret entrance to Olympus.But Percy is not quite home free yet. There&#39;s ten more minutes until the midnight deadline, and Luke has arrived, wearing another pair of his father&#39;s flying shoes, to make sure Percy misses that deadline. Questioned by Percy, Luke reveals that when Percy, Grover and Annabeth came to see him about traveling to the underworld, he saw it as the perfect opportunity to dupe Percy into the very role Hermes normally performs... messenger of the gods. Luke hid the lightning bolt in the shield and gave the shield to Percy, so that Percy could unwittingly deliver the bolt to Hades. Reminding Percy that he bears as much animosity toward his divine parent as nearly all the demigods have for theirs, Luke wants to see them go to war and destroy themselves, believing that the demigods could then take over and rule the world as they see fit.Swooping at Percy, Luke knocks him to the ground and seizes the lightning bolt. Drawing a dagger, Annabeth engages him and fends him off, although she cannot defeat Luke while he has the lightning bolt and the flying shoes. Luke takes off into the skies. Percy reaches into his backpack and takes out the flying shoes Luke had given him, and takes off in pursuit.Luke is about to cast lightning at a passing helicopter when Percy dives at him. They wrestle in mid-air until Luke breaks free and tries to blast Percy with lightning. There is a brief cat-and-mouse game through a skyscraper&#39;s interior until Percy catches Luke by surprise and wrests the lightning bolt from him. Now it is Luke pursuing Percy, trying to recover it.Percy is almost back at the Empire State Building when Luke hurls a knife that slices the wings off of Percy&#39;s flying shoes. No longer able to control his flight, Percy tumbles to a hard landing on a rooftop. Luke picks up the lightning bolt, and questions Percy&#39;s heritage as son of Poseidon. Percy sees several water towers atop nearby buildings and concentrates, breaking the tanks open and gathering the water to deluge Luke. Gathering some of the remaining water and shaping it into a trident, Percy says that he must be the son of Poseidon after all. Hurling the trident, he catches Luke across the throat between two of the prongs, taking Luke clear out of his flying shoes and casting him into the river.Donning Luke&#39;s shoes, Percy arrives back at the Empire State building with the lightning bolt. Sally and Annabeth flip several switches in a control box in the service closet, which acrivates the hidden secret elevator that takes them all up, far past the roof of the building, into the heavens before the gates of Olympus. Sally, as a mortal, is unable to venture forth onto the divine ground. Annabeth and Percy rush to the hall of the gods.Inside the hall, the deities of the Greek Pantheon are engaged in heated argument until Zeus demands silence and crosses to a time-dial in the center of the great hall. Poseidon and Athena, despite their enmity, both make a final appeal to Zeus to avoid war. But as the time-dial signals the arrival of midnight and the passing of the deadline, Zeus is about to pronounce judgement of war. Just then, Percy and Annabeth rush into the hall bearing the lightning bolt. Zeus demands its return, and Percy does so. The bolt grows to its true size in Zeus&#39; grasp. He says that Percy is wise to betray his father. Percy retorts that he was never working with or for Poseidon&#39;s benefit, and he reveals Luke as the true lightning thief (to the great surprise of Hermes (Dylan Neal)), explaining that Luke resented all the gods for not caring about their children, and he wanted them to destroy each other so the demigods could rule Olympus. The gods all look around at each other, seeing how they had been played and pitted against one another. Zeus accepts Percy&#39;s explanation and declares peace. Athena (Melina Kanakaredes) smiles at Annabeth and tells her she&#39;s very proud of her.Percy mentions that he and Annabeth escaped the Underworld only because Grover stayed behind. Zeus smiles cynically as he realizes that Percy wants him to return Grover to the world of the living. However, he agrees to the request. Zeus declares the convening of the gods to be adjourned. Poseidon makes a plea to his brother that he be allowed to speak to Percy, and Zeus consents-- but just this once.Percy is naturally resentful that Poseidon was never around, and that he never got to even meet him. Poseidon acknowledges that Percy was only seven months when he left him and Sally. He says that being with him and his mother, Sally, made Poseidon start to forget his duties and become more human, which Zeus didn&#39;t approve of. Percy is surprised on hearing that Poseidon&#39;s siring him was what led Zeus to pass the divine rule prohibiting the gods from having any contact with their children. Poseidon manages to come to terms with Percy, saying he never wanted to leave him or Sally, and was in fact always with him in heart and spirit; Percy acknowledging he heard Poseidon&#39;s voice when he spoke to Percy. Poseidon promises that while he might not get to see Percy again, he will always be there with and for him-- in his heart, in his thoughts, and in his dreams. Percy forgives his father and shakes hands with him.Sally brings Percy back to Camp Half Blood, where he can fulfill his destiny as a demigod. Although she will miss him, she says it&#39;s where he belongs. She also says, to Percy&#39;s great relief, that she is finally kicking Ugliano out of the house, now that he has served his purpose and she doesn&#39;t need him anymore.Percy is welcomed by everyone back at the camp, and Grover shows him that he&#39;s been promoted to senior protector, and has finally gotten his Satyr horns. Chiron starts to admonish Percy for disobeying his orders and leaving camp without permission, but then says that this is why Percy is now his favorite student-- many times he simply has to follow his own instincts. But hero or not, Percy is, to Chiron, still one of his students, and He sends Percy to suit up for more training.As Grover and Percy walk through the training area, Grover amuses Percy with stories of Grover&#39;s time in the underworld as Persephone&#39;s paramour. They find Annabeth in the same manner in which Percy first set eyes on her-- she is taking on several other students in swordplay at the same time, holding her own and more. Grover pats Percy&#39;s shoulder and tells him that he can handle this on his own now. After defeating the last of her opponents, Annabeth calls for the next one, and Percy steps up to volunteer. Annabeth puts a hand on his neck, welcoming him home and leaning in as if to kiss him. Suddenly with a mischevious look, she surprises Percy by swiping his sword out of its scabbard and pointing her own at him, telling him that he must never be distracted by an opponent. Percy grins and motions for his sword back. She returns it and they square off. The camera slowly pans back as Percy and Annabeth begin their battle, and the credits start to roll.Midway through the credits is an extra scene showing Sally telling Gabe to take all his things with him. He goes to the kitchen in disgust for a beer and finds the refrigerator locked, with a note from Percy on the door, warning that the refrigerator door must never be opened again. Annoyed, Gabe smashes the lock off and opens the door... and finds the severed head of Medusa inside. Fade to black as the snake heads lunge out, and the credits resume.

|2h 9min |[Crime, Drama, Mystery]     |From a cell, a man tells us he has planned the perfect bank robbery; he invites us to watch. An efficient gang enters a Manhattan bank, locks the doors, and takes hostages. They work deliberately, without haste. Detective Frazier is assigned to negotiate, but half his mind is occupied with the corruption charges he is facing. The bank&#39;s president has something to protect in a safe deposit box, so he brings in Madeleine White, a high-power broker with a hidden agenda. With an army of police surrounding the bank, the thief, the cop, and the plutocrat&#39;s fixer enter high-stakes negotiations. Why are the robbers asking for a plane, if they are so competent and they know they won&#39;t get one? Why aren&#39;t they in more of a hurry? If the job&#39;s perfect, why is the thieves&#39; leader in a cell?                Written by

He says that he is &#34;stuck in a tiny cell&#34; (we see a small portion of this cell, and Dalton writing in a journal and doing push-ups), and that he recently executed a bank robbery. He describes the who (himself), the what (the robbery), the where (his current location in &#39;a tiny cell&#39;), the when (recently) and the why (because he can). He says the only question remaining is how the robbery was completed.A man gets into a Chevrolet Express van parked next to the Coney Island Cyclone. The driver is shown driving through Brooklyn, making a streetside pickup for another painter. The van then enters Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge and picks up a final passenger in Chinatown, before parking the van outside a branch of the Manhattan Trust Bank at 20 Exchange Place near Broadway and Wall Street. The driver and passengers are dressed alike in painter&#39;s clothes.As employees and customers at the bank carry on their business, the painters begin to unload what appear to be paint and painting supplies onto hand carts. Dalton, who is one of the painters, walks into the bank, and we recognize him despite the clothes and dark. He places two large, high-intensity flashlights on one of the small service tables in the center of the bank&#39;s lobby. He turns them on and points them at two of the bank&#39;s security cameras, blinding them.The other painters follow him into the bank but nobody notices them locking the doors shut. When they raise their masks over their mouths and noses, a guard approaches and questions what they are doing. Dalton walks up behind him and puts a gun into his side. The other painters rush in, brandishing firearms and dropping smoke bombs, and subdue the other customers.A passing NYPD patrol officer, Sergeant Collins (Victor Collichio), happens to see smoke coming out from under the bank doors. When he attempts to open the doors, he finds they are locked and calls police dispatch. Dalton unlocks a door and points a large .357 Magnum in his face. In a fake European accent, he tells Collins he has hostages and threatens to kill them if the cops come too close. He then retreats inside the bank and re-locks the doors. Removing his pistol from his holster, Collins begins clearing the street of pedestrians as he radios for help.The scene changes to an NYPD precinct in a different part of Manhattan, Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is on the phone with his patrol officer girlfriend Sylvia (Cassandra Freeman). They are discussing a corruption investigation involving Frazier that involves a crooked drug-dealer who set Frazier up to appear as if he embezzled a large sum of drug-deal money. The charge is holding up his being considered for promotion to Detective First Grade, which would give him the money to buy a house and marry Sylvia. He&#39;s mildly disconcerted that Sylvia&#39;s brother is a petty bumbling crook who has spent time in lockup for trying to rip off a car. Sylvia insists that he&#39;s the only family she&#39;s got. Frazier and Sylvia finish the conversation with &#34;sweet nothings&#34; and looking forward to a romantic tryst at home that night.Frazier&#39;s partner, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) briefly discuss how Sylvia&#39;s brother is a thorn in Frazier&#39;s side, though Frazier acknowledges that Sylvia still loves him despite his bumbling attempts at petty heists, and he can&#39;t put the young man out of their house.Their conversation is interrupted by their commanding officer, Captain Coughlin (Peter Gerety), who informs them that he&#39;s assigning them to work the hostage situation happening at the Manhattan Trust Bank. Jumping at the offer, they hurry to get to the bank.While this is happening, the police arrive in full force at the Manhattan Trust, including numerous patrol officers, a mobile command center, and the Emergency Services Unit. Barricades are set up to cordon off the block with quick efficiency. ESU Sergeant Hernandez (Jason Manuel Olazabal), leader of the ESU unit, meets with Collins to get a preliminary report.Word of the bank robbery also is sent to the bank&#39;s founder and chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). When told by his secretary, his concern at the hostage situation is clear, but he is notably more concerned when his secretary tells him the robbery is taking place at the branch at 20 Exchange Place.Frazier arrives and makes contact with Sergeant Collins, who briefs him on what little he&#39;s seen of the situation, and they prepare to get to work.In the bank, the robbers are also conducting their own operation with cool efficiency. They herd all the hostages downstairs to where the vault is. One of the robbers, clearly a woman, separates the bank employees from the customers. Dalton announces that his cohorts are going to be collecting everyone&#39;s cell phones and keys. They find one bank employee with no cell phone. Dalton confronts the employee, Peter Hammond (Peter Frechette) and warns him not to try and play hero by hiding his phone. Hammond insists he left his phone at home. Dalton grabs the bags containing all the collected cell phones and begins looking through their speed-dial memories. After tossing a number of phones aside, he finds one that has Hammond&#39;s cell phone number on it. He calls the phone and immediately a distinctive ring tone is audible from Hammond&#39;s office. Dalton retrieves it and holds it up before Hammond. Busted and now terrified, Hammond begs for his life. Dalton doesn&#39;t shoot him, but does drag Hammond into hiss office and proceeds to use his fists and feet to viciously beat Hammond senseless.Dalton then separates the men and women hostages and orders them to undress. A few have to be &#39;encouraged&#39; with a gun held up close to their faces but finally they all strip to their underwear. One woman in late middle age still refuses even when threatened directly, even telling Dalton to go ahead and kill her. Dalton has the woman bank robber, who he calls Stevie (Kim Director) lead the woman away to be &#39;dealt with in private.&#39; Dalton then distributes painter&#39;s suits with fumes masks and dark shades, ordering everyone to put them on. Now the hostages and robbers are all indistinguishable from one another.Frazier and Mitchell meet the ESU Captain, John Darius (Willem Dafoe). None of the police yet know how many perps are inside, nor how many hostages. Frazier announces he and Mitchell will wait for a call from Darius at the nearest diner once a briefing is ready.Inside the bank, one of the hostages is coughing and wheezing uncontrollably. Grabbing him, Dalton ushers him to the door and pushes him outside into the waiting arms of the police. Unable to immediately determine if he is a perp or hostage, the police handcuff him and lead him away.At this point, the movie begins to periodically shift between the main storyline, and Frazier and Mitchell interviewing hostages at the precinct after the robbery has ended. They are trying to pick out the perpetrators from the rest of the hostages.One of the hostages (Rodney &#39;Bear&#39; Jackson), who works as a bank security guard, is being interviewed, and he is speaking to Frazier and Mitchell about his being afraid he&#39;d never see his family again. He speaks about his wife and children and wondering if he&#39;d get to hold them again.Dalton and his accomplices are seen inspecting the layout of the bank. They walk past the vault, the safe deposit boxes, and into a store room where various stationery and other office equipment is. Dalton looks at the store room and says, &#39;Beautiful.&#39;The scene changes to an office elsewhere in Manhattan where a high power &#34;fixer&#34;, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), is interviewing a nephew of Osama bin Laden&#39;s, who is purchasing property in the city. She makes note that the nephew is doing no business with his uncle and hasn&#39;t seen him in nine years (around the time of bin Laden&#39;s bombing of the US embassies). The interview is interrupted by White&#39;s assistant who tells her that Arthur Case is on the phone.White takes the call, specifically asking her assistant if Case made the call personally or whether a secretary announced that she was placing the call for him. Assured that Case is on the line himself, White has the call patched through. Case, knowing White&#39;s profession, explains that he has a small problem requiring a person with &#39;special skills and complete discretion.&#39; She assures him she is more than capable of doing such a job.Frazier and Mitchell are interviewing a number of hostages about the robbery. Peter Hammond (his face visibly bruised) speaks about how the robbers were &#39;insistent and yet detached.&#39; A young man whose face was not seen before tells the detectives that the perps called each other a variation of &#39;Steven--&#39; Steve, Steve-O, and Stevie (the woman perp). The employee with the heart condition (Gerry Vichi) is saying the only thing he ever stole was a nickel from his grandmother when he was a boy.Captain Darius summons Frazier and Mitchell and briefs them on what he&#39;s learned from the released hostage, Herman Gluck, who is 73 and who was released after complaining of chest pains. He is currently being treated by paramedics. From Gluck, Darius says the perps told him to say to the police that if any officers approached the door, two dead bodies would be thrown out. Gluck said he believes there are four perps in total conducting the robbery. He&#39;s having the department arrange to download the video feed from the bank&#39;s security system from its main office. The block is secured with snipers in key locations, and they&#39;re checking with the DEP about sewer grates. Frazier announces he&#39;s going to wait for the perps to make the first move, wait and see what they do.White and Case are walking along the riverside, discussing what Case needs. He has precious family heirlooms inside his safety deposit box at the branch that is being held up. White is suspicious that Case personally called her instead of acting through his people, saying it means that the safety box contains something that Case doesn&#39;t want to even hint at, even to his closest and most trusted aides. She tells him, coolly but curtly, that she doesn&#39;t need to be told what the box contains, but if she discovers it&#39;s something much more serious than anything Case might hint at, their agreement is over. Case, also speaking curtly, tells her that the box contains items that he&#39;s had since before White was born, and pose no danger to anyone--although White notes, &#39;except to you.&#39; Case and White both clearly distrust each other, are suspicious of one another&#39;s honesty, and don&#39;t particularly like each other... but she assures him she can ensure that nobody discovers the contents, or even the existence, of his safe deposit box. Case has no reason to believe the robbers are targetting the box, or are even aware of it, but he is taking extremely great pains to avoid taking any chances.In the bank&#39;s storeroom, Steve (Carlos Andrés Gómez) is telling Dalton that it&#39;s time for Steve-O (James Ransone), who begins using a pickaxe to dig under the floor of the storeroom.Outside, using a tip from the released hostages that the robbers are dressed as painters, Mitchell and Fraizer identify a parked Chevrolet Express van with decals on the side reading &#34;Perfectly Planned Painting... We NEVER Leave Until the Job is _Done._&#34; Frazier quickly determines that it&#39;s just a peel-away decal, and finds that it is covering the white stencilling marking the van as belonging to an electric company... meaning it&#39;s stolen.Inside the MCC, Frazier calls the bank to establish contact. Dalton is shown sitting at the desk, watching the phone ring, but chooses not to answer. An officer inside the center, named Rourke (Daryl Mitchell) brings up the video feed from the camera&#39;s security system. They see each camera go out and lose transmission one by one, and pick out Dalton shining what appear to be flashlights at them. He deduces the flashlights emitted infrared light pulses, which is invisible to humans but is picked up by the cameras. It allowed Dalton to knock out the cameras very discretely without anyone noticing what he was doing. He did this at about 10 am, and for two minutes there is no video footage of anyone entering or leaving the bank.Frazier and Mitchell are seen questioning Miriam (Marcia Jean Kurtz), the hostage who refused to undress. She is still frightened and in tears even after the ordeal was finished.The perps release another hostage from the bank, his hands behind him and something placed around his chest. When he doesn&#39;t respond to police orders, they note his hands are tied and pat him down thoroughly. Pulling off the mask and shades, they find a blindfold and gag underneath them. Once released, the hostage says he is Vikram Walla (Waris Ahluwalia) and he is a bank employee. He is Sikh, and the officers mistake him for Arab, causing them to jump, and they think he has a bomb hanging from his neck. When the device is taken, he is roughly seized and hauled away, the officers pulling his turban away, much to his outrage. Frazier and Mitchell look closely at the device taken from him, but don&#39;t touch it.White pays a visit to the mayor (Peter Kybart), who greets her very cordially and pleasantly and they begin to speak in a very friendly manner about assorted business while walking out of the mayor&#39;s press room. No sooner are they behind closed doors when their respective demeanors change in an instant--the mayor outright despises White and is extremely happy to hear that the favor she is here for, is the last she intends to ask him. White tells the mayor she&#39;s going down to the hostage situation and she needs the mayor to make sure that she is afforded &#34;every courtesy&#34; by the &#34;people in charge.&#34; The mayor is outraged, noting that he&#39;ll have to do more than call in favors--he&#39;d end up owing quite a few, much to his displeasure. White clearly has enough influence to get the mayor to do what she asks, though it&#39;s not revealed what sort.Frazier, Mitchell and Darius are questioning a very hostile and angry Vikram (though this is while the robbery is still going on). Vikram is extremely upset about the seizing of his turban, which is paramount to his Sikh religion. Frazier does everything possible to soothe his ruffled feathers and asks Vikram to concentrate on the safety of his co-workers. Vikram reveals he believes there to be four robbers and somewhere between twenty and forty hostages. The perps are all armed and making no mistakes.Frazier opens the case that was hung around Vikram&#39;s neck. It is empty, though there is writing on the inside of it--demands from the robbers. They want two buses with a full gas tank, a fully fueled and manned jumbo jet waiting for them at John F. Kennedy International Airport, all by 9 pm. After that, a hostage will be executed in front of TV cameras every hour. The bank is secured with Semtex (a plastic explosive with military uses), and the robbers will demonstrate if necessary. Frazier says the perps won&#39;t even get a cup of coffee until he talks to them. He&#39;s going to give them time to wonder what the police are up to.Collins shows Case into the MCC and introduces him to Frazier, Mitchell and Darius. He seems curiously relieved when he is told the robbers are asking for a jet, and even offers to arrange one for them. Sounding tired and out of breath, he asks to remain with them, but of course, as a civilian, he cannot be afforded this, and they promise to keep him updated but have him sent on his way to await news.Dalton steps outside of the bank and hands one of the officers a piece of paper which instructs the cops to deliver enough food to feed all the hostages. In the command center, Officer Berk (Ashlie Atkinson) suggests pizza, as the pizza boxes can conceal hidden transmitters and lots of the people will group around the boxes, allowing for more efficient recording. Frazier notes that he is not going ask anything from the robbers in return for the pizza, as they have already released two hostages. He knows that the robbers have everything well-planned and he is not willing to risk getting caught bluffing them.Inside the bank, one of the hostages finally gets frustrated and pulls off his mask, arguing with his fellow hostages over his losing control. Finally Dalton storms in, grabs him by his ankle, drags him into the storeroom and punches him out.Another &#39;after the robbery questioning&#39; is shown, Frazier and Mitchell tricking a man into removing his hearing aids and demonstrating he is able to hear their questions without them.The pizzas and bottled water are delivered. Frazier introduces himself to Dalton while the three Stevens quickly shuttle the food inside the bank. He tells Dalton to pick up the phone at any time. Dalton simply stares at Frazier, saying nothing, and then locks the doors again.Through the hidden transmitters, the command center personnel hear a foreign language spoken. Believing it to be Russian, Frazier has Mitchell check with Gluck and Vikram to see if they remember hearing any of the robbers speaking Russian.Steve and Stevie are shown herding hostages around from room to room to keep them disoriented. During the procedure, unseen by any of the hostages, Stevie hands Steve her gun, doffs her gloves and shades and puts on an eye mask like those the hostages are being made to wear, and begins acting as though she is crying hysterically, in a loud voice for the hostages to hear, so that it appears that Stevie is in fact one of the hostages. Steve roughly ushers her into a room and makes her sit down. He then grabs another female hostage about the same height as Stevie, who he treats rudely, calling her &#39;boobs&#39; because of her large bust. He ushers her into another room, while making sure all the hostages have their masks on and are keeping their hands on the ground.More &#39;after-the-robbery questioning&#39; scenes are shown. Nancy Mann (Samantha Ivers), a woman who was talking loudly on her cell phone just before the robbers struck, angrily rails about the hostage who took off his mask and started acting up until punched out by Dalton (the name Darius Peltz is written on the photograph).Stevie is seen working in the storeroom, cleaning up after a hole has been dug in the floor. Her cleavage spills out of her tank-top t-shirt, much like the female hostage Steve rudely called &#39;boobs&#39; while ushering her from one room to another.In the MCC, the officers are going over the recording made through the bugged pizza boxes. Another officer skilled in linguistics is unable to correctly identify the language, although he believes it is Central European. Frazier comes up with an idea: one of the bystanders standing behind the barricades on the street probably will recognize the language. He has Berk broadcast the recording through the MCC&#39;s speakers, and goes out to the barricades, asking pedestrians if anyone understands the language.A sanitation worker named Kevin (Al Palagonia) comes forward, saying that the language is Albanian. Unfortunately, he himself cannot translate it for the officers: he only recognizes the language because his ex-wife and her parents are Albanian natives and he recognizes the language from listening to her speak with her parents, who knew no English at all.A check on the van, meanwhile, reveals that it was stolen two days earlier, but has also been wiped clean of fingerprints.In the bank, Dalton is bringing pizza and a water bottle to Brian Robinson (Amir Ali Said), the eight-year-old son of one of the hostages, who is sitting in the bank&#39;s vault playing a hand-held video game which has kept him occupied throughout the whole ordeal. Dalton sits beside him and watches him eat. Dalton is far more civil, respectful, even humble, with Brian than he&#39;d been shown as conducting himself at any time prior to this moment. He picks up Brian&#39;s video game and asks him how it works, seeming appalled at how brutally violent it is, reveling in the most cutthroat &#39;gangzta&#39; violence.The police run into trouble trying to get an interpreter to translate the Albanian dialogue, as the Albanian Consulate and the State Department, outside the city jurisdiction, are refusing to send someone to help. With no other options, Frazier tells Kevin, insistently, to call his ex-wife and ask her to come to the site so she can translate.A brief scene is shown where Dalton stands in the vault, removing his mask and shades as he stares at the cash on the vault&#39;s shelves.Back in the MCC, Kevin&#39;s Albanian ex-wife, Ilina (Florina Petcu) is escorted into the MCC. Ilina is a sultry, vain, self-centered woman who seems to understand how badly the Mobile Command Center officers need her help and takes the time to enjoy lording over them, brazenly lighting up a cigarette over Mitchell&#39;s admonishments not to smoke inside the MCC, and handing Frazier a bag full of unpaid parking tickets, which she expects him to &#39;fix&#39; in return for her services. Ilina listens to the recording and breaks into a light, completely amused laugh: not only does she know what is being said, but the voice that they&#39;re hearing is that of Enver Hoxha... the former President of Albania, who has been deceased for 20 years. They are listening to a tape recording of a speech Hoxha made during his presidency, about the greatness of Albanian people--a Marxist-Leninist propaganda speech. Frazier and Mitchell are left back at square one, steaming over how they&#39;d been outplayed. Dalton and crew not only knew that the pizza boxes were bugged, they were counting on it--to send the hapless detectives on a wild goose chase.Back in the bank, Steve chows down on pizza as the transmission device, easily located by him and his colleagues, is carefully placed near an iPod that is still transmitting the recording of the Hoxha propaganda speech.Stevie and Dalton go into the bank&#39;s safety deposit box room. Stevie places a key into safety deposit box 392 and carefully picks the second lock. She opens the hatch and pulls out the deposit box, where Dalton carefully undoes a large, twine-and-button closure on a suede envelope holder resting on top of the box&#39;s contents. He pulls out a manila envelope that has Arthur Case&#39;s name on it, and contains a number of legal documents. Dalton glances at Stevie, who smiles complacently she looks back at Dalton. Underneath the envelope, still in the safety deposit box, rest a large number of black velvet pouches tied with drawstrings... and a red jewelry box suitable for holding a ring. Dalton takes the documents to the desk just outside the safety deposit vault as Stevie closes the deposit box back up.White arrives with the mayor in a sleek black GMC SUV is allowed through the barricade and summon Fraizer for a meeting. The three begin a careful parley about White having influence that may be of use to Frazier, for reasons Frazier is not privy to because of his &#39;pay grade,&#39; and that in turn leads to a careful parley about his promotion possibly being pushed through the red tape holding it up.Collins and Hernandez are making more preparations for a potential storming of the bank, while inside the command center, Frazier finally makes contact with Dalton over the phone. After the ice is broken over calling out Dalton over the Hoxha tape, the negotiations get down to the nitty-gritty. Dalton takes command, warning Frazier that the many innocent lives at stake rob him of any power to call any shots in the negotiations. Dalton talks, Frazier listens, and complies promptly with all demands, or people stop breathing--permanently. Once the conversation is ended, Frazier is troubled at how completely calm Dalton sounded. Someone who was completely sure of himself and in control of his surroundings.Meanwhile, White sits in the diner used as the waiting point, watching everything she can see from her vantage point.In another &#39;after-the-robbery&#39; scene, Frazier and Mitchell are interviewing another hostage--or not; the &#39;hostage&#39; is Steve, although Frazier and Mitchell don&#39;t know that. Steve has given his name as Kenneth Damerjian. The interrogation reveals a key point in Dalton&#39;s making all the hostages dress up in the painter outfits with masks and shades, just like he and his fellow robbers, along with the hostages being constantly moved from room to room, as well as each of the &#39;Stevens&#39; taking turns pretending to be hostages... it allowed them to mingle with the true hostages and, during key points, they all unmasked so the hostages saw their faces and could point them out from the photographs as being fellow hostages. Steve&#39;s dialogue shows that he deliberately misbehaved during his time impersonating a hostage, so others would see him being treated as one--at one point, his colleagues even bound and gagged him as &#39;punishment,&#39; and Frazier saw him that way.Frazier is negotiating again with Dalton on the phone, making little headway against Dalton&#39;s continuous warnings that Frazier is in no position to do anything other than exactly what Dalton already told him to do, because so many lives depend on it. Frazier desperately tries to bargain for extra time, offering to bring more food for the robbers and hostages.Dalton finally offers Frazier a bone. He asks Frazier a riddle; which weighs more, all the trees cut down to print all US currency presently in circulation, or all the trains passing through Grand Central Station in a year. If Frazier answers correctly, he gets more time. If not, someone could be dying very soon. Dalton offers one hint: it&#39;s a trick question.The MCC team furiously ponders the riddle, until Darius points out that US money is not printed on paper at all, but cotton fibers, meaning no trees were cut down. Frazier calls Dalton and is just about to answer that the trains weigh more when Mitchell stops him, makes him hang up, and says it&#39;s a trap: Frazier must tell Dalton that both weigh the same. Frazier does so, and Dalton tells him to send sandwiches this time (which will allow the hostages to spread out while they eat, so no hidden bugs can be planted).Mitchell explains that Grand Central STATION is the proper term for the post office in that area, while the hub of train platforms is properly called Grand Central TERMINAL or just Grand Central.Inside one of the rooms in the bank, a number of hostages are passing time in conversation. One of them, a Hasidic man named Chaim (Bernard Rachelle), mentions he is a professor of criminal law at Columbia, teaching courses on genocide, slave labor and war reparation. He is also a former attorney.Dalton, Stevie and Steve-O are examining the finished hole dug in the storeroom floor, and Steve-O dryly remarks, &#39;Now that&#39;s a good-looking shithole.&#39;Frazier calls Sylvia, who is relaxing at home, although she is very anxious about Frazier&#39;s well-being. They talk a little about the ongoing situation and Frazier hopes to finish it up very soon. As he finishes the conversation, he lightly raps on the diner window, signaling White to come outside. After making her promise that she understands the &#39;ground rules&#39; they talked about earlier, Frazier uses his cell phone to contact Dalton inside the bank so that White can talk to him directly. Madeline tells Dalton that if she is allowed to make sure that &#39;certain interests are protected,&#39; she can help him get what he came for. The conversation between Dalton and White is another carefully worded cat-and-mouse game where it is very unclear who is the cat. But White succeeds in getting something: after she assures Dalton that she is neither a bank employee nor a police officer, he tells her that she can come into the bank and talk to him face to face.Frazier and two officers escort White to the bank doors, and Frazier warns her that after ten minutes, as far as he is concerned, White can count herself as another hostage. Once inside the bank, White is made to lie on the floor while Stevie pats her down to ensure she is unarmed. Dalton waits behind the teller counters. As White approaches, Dalton asks why she thinks he needs her help, shrugging off her reply about the vertiable army of police outside. White presents her offer: If Dalton gives up now, she can make sure he&#39;ll get no more than the minimum prison sentence, and when it&#39;s completed, he&#39;ll have two million dollars waiting for him to pick up from a safe place. Dalton takes the terms with an air of what is plainly mock surprise, and then turns it down. He then asks White, again, to tell him about the &#39;interests&#39; she&#39;s trying to protect.When White says she can&#39;t talk about them, Dalton stuns her by saying that he can--he already knows why White is here--he even knows something she doesn&#39;t. He tells her a story about an American man who was working for a Swiss bank during World War II. He used his position with the Nazis to enrich himself while people all around him were being stripped at gunpoint of everything they owned, and then used his blood money to start a bank. In fact, the man Dalton is describing is Case, who at this same time is in his office looking wistfully at a large number of awards given him by Jewish interest groups and charity organizations for his long years of service to their causes.Dalton finishes up by asking White if this man he is telling her about, sounds like the man she might be working for. Defeated but trying to act like she hasn&#39;t been, White says she and Dalton understand each other. When Dalton repeats his question as to what help White can offer him, since he&#39;s shown he knows a lot more than her about what&#39;s going on, and has planned everything so completely, White sharply rebuffs that she still has enough power in the games being played to throw a serious monkey wrench into Dalton&#39;s plans. She wants two minutes to go into one safety deposit box and retrieve something from there. But again, Dalton shows he&#39;s one step ahead of everyone--including White herself. He shows her the legal documentation (a Nazi swastika can be plainly seen on one of the pages) he&#39;s taken from the box, saying that it now belongs to him as its previous owner was too careless to destroy them when he had the chance. Dalton is keeping them as leverage--if he is ever captured and put on trial for the robbery, White and her employer will have to use all their resources to get him off the hook. When White asks how Dalton plans to get out of the bank, he casually says he will walk right out the front door.Back outside the bank, Frazier is debriefing White on the conversation with Dalton. He&#39;s far too smart to fall for her carefully worded answers, but has little in the way of pressuring her into telling everything he wants. White believes Dalton will not kill anyone, but Frazier is unconvinced. Dalton doesn&#39;t appear to have been pushed into a corner; he seems to have chosen to go there. White has done all she can in the situation and Frazier dismisses her after a brief exchange of words culminating in a subtle warning from White that she is still a major figure on the chess board.More post-robbery interrogations follow:Brian and his father, Ray (Ed Onipede Blunt) are being interviewed. Brian is able to tell them a little about Dalton, although not enough for them to have a lead. Everyone all looked the same, especially to Brian, as the hostages were made to dress identically to the robbers including hoods and masks. Another former hostage, Paul Guiterrez (Lemon Andersen) is shown to have a rap sheet, leading Frazier and Mitchell to press him hard in an attempt to trick him into revealing something that only one of the robbers would know, but to no avail. They are speaking the hard-of-hearing Jewish man again, showing photos of Darius Peltz and Kenneth Damerjian--Peltz (the hostage who pulled off his mask and was punched out by Dalton) is Steve-O, showing that all three &#39;Stevens&#39; all acted up at some point while posing as hostages until Dalton came in to &#39;discipline&#39; them; all part of the act so all three &#39;Stevens&#39; would appear as fellow hostages. The Jewish man looks at the photos but cannot determine anything suspicious about them. Finally Frazier and Mitchell are seen interviewing Stevie. Noting her large bust, they say there&#39;s only one other woman among the hostages besides her who fit the physical description of the female suspect--moderately tall, young, and large-busted. But Stevie does not break or back down; her answers are cool and sardonic, and the detectives cannot pick out anything that separates her from the other hostages.Frazier, Mitchell and Darius are in the MCC discussing hostage-takers all wanting planes, and never getting them, yet they keep demanding one whenever another hostage situation arises. Frazier is thoughtful for a moment and then picks up the phone to call Dalton. He explains to Mitchell that he doesn&#39;t buy Dalton&#39;s insistence that Frazier be quick about the plane--he believes that Dalton knows hostage-negotiating procedures and is using the &#39;tricks of the trade&#39; against them. As negotiatiors, Frazier and Mitchell need to do whatever they can to stall for time, but Frazier believes that Dalton is actually the one stalling--the Enver Hoxha tape, the trick-question riddle; Dalton keeps providing subtle loopholes allowing him to give Frazier more time. Dalton is not in a hurry to go anywhere.Frazier calls Dalton and bluffs him, saying the plane is ready, but he needs to come into the bank and make sure the hostages are okay, and none of them have been killed. Dalton agrees.Frazier is let into the bank and frisked by Steve-O before being led up the stairs inside. Dalton leads Frazier through a series of connecting offices where the hostages sit, masked and clothed the same as Dalton and the other robbers. Brian alone is in his regular street clothes, as he is too small to fit into the appropriate &#39;disguise.&#39; Frazier asks for Brian to be released, but Dalton demurs.Frazier asks if there are any other hostages. Dalton says that some had misbehaved, and they are in the next room. He opens the door where Frazier sees a number of hostages who are bound and gagged--among them Stevie, crying as she tries to dislodge her gag, and Steve. All part of the plan so the two of them, and Steve-O, could not be picked out from the other hostages.Dalton says the tour is over and he and Steve-O begin leading Frazier back out. Frazier finally confronts Dalton, admitting no plane is ready and that Dalton probably doesn&#39;t even want one because he&#39;s been stalling for time, and Frazier wants to know why. Dalton coolly answers that he knows Frazier&#39;s commanding officer will not order a siege when no hostages have been killed and there&#39;s no threat, and even if it happened, Frazier would not be the hero.Near the door, Frazier asks if Dalton wouldn&#39;t just walk out the front door, and Dalton says he will do so when he&#39;s ready. After a bit of small talk, Frazier offers Dalton a handshake, which turns out to be a ploy to get Dalton to drop his guard just long enough for Frazier to grab him and wrestle him to the ground. Unfortunately Steve-O is there with his rifle jammed into Frazier&#39;s back before Frazier can effect a capture. Frazier is forced to bank off, hands up, as he nervously looks at Steve-O and Dalton&#39;s readied weapons. They push him out of the bank where he is met by Mitchell.Steve-O and Dalton go to the supply room where Steve is working. Steve-O confronts Dalton on Frazier almost capturing him. Dalton impatiently asks Steve, &#39;how long?&#39; and Steve says that it will be two hours; maybe three.Frazier enters the MCC and briefs Darius. He gave Dalton every reason to kill him, but Dalton didn&#39;t bite--he now believes White&#39;s claim that Dalton isn&#39;t the type to murder. The whole robbery has been planned with utmost care--the Hoxha speech tape, the disguises, the demand for a plane even though he didn&#39;t really expect one; Frazier knows Dalton is up to something specific, but it&#39;s not violence.But at that moment, the phone rings; Dalton is making contact. He tells Frazier to have the MCC&#39;s camera zoom in on a second-floor window.Officer Rourke zooms in and the camera reveals Dalton and five others in a semi-circle around a seventh person whose head is covered in a white sack. Dalton holds up a hand, then levels a pistol at the seventh person and fires his gun point-blank. A spray of blood comes through the sack as the executed hostage slowly crumples to the ground; the other five people cringing and crying out in horror and fear. Frazier looks on, shaken to the core, before hurrying to the bank&#39;s front door and pounding on it.Dalton is there on the opposite side of the door. He and Frazier have it out in a verbal argument. Frazier insists that the police command all know that the whole &#39;bank robbery&#39; is a sham, but Dalton is unruffled, saying he told Frazier to get the buses. Frazier tries to press for what Dalton really wants so he can get it for him, but Dalton sticks to the &#39;buses and a plane&#39; demand. Frazier calls him out, telling Dalton he&#39;s not buying the routine anymore. Dalton opens the door and points his gun at Frazier, demanding he leave. But Frazier stands his ground, challenging Dalton to kill him. Dalton curses Frazier out and tells him to have the command center send someone sane the next time they want to talk to him.Captain Darius calls his superiors to report the shooting. As Frazier is returning to the MCC, he finds Captain Coughlin waiting for him. Coughlin allows Frazier to say very little. He had gone to bed and the hostage situation was proceeding smoothly, then was called at 3:15 am and told of a murdered hostage. Coughlin tells Frazier that Captain Darius is now in charge, and Frazier does nothing without Darius&#39; approval. Mitchell is exasperated to hear that he and Frazier are no longer in control.Coughlin and Darius are studying blueprints of the bank with a number of police ESU leaders, preparing to storm the bank and end the situation. We see scenes of an imagined siege scenario as the officers discuss and plan. The biggest problem is that they cannot tell who will be a hostage and who will be a perp until the perps start shooting. They decide to use rubber bullets to avoid hostage casualties.It is morning again, and Mitchell and Frazier are talking. Mitchell knows that if the siege goes down wrong, the mess will be dumped into Frazier&#39;s lap and he will be the scapegoat. But Frazier reveals the &#39;deal&#39; that White and the Mayor made with him to push his promotion to First Grade through channels. Mitchell is shocked and stares gravely as Frazier heads outside for some air.Frazier makes small talk with Sergeant Collins, who feels that Frazier is being cheated at being excluded from the storming of the bank. Frazier conversationally asks Collins about the last time he had a gun pointed at him. Collins carelessly drops a racial slur but apologizes when Frazier calls him out on it. After Collins tells his story, he promises to speak more carefully in the future, because &#39;you never know who&#39;s listening in.&#39;Frazier&#39;s face changes quickly. He rushes back into the MCC and grabs the metal case sent out with Vikram Walia, which contained the original demands. He wrenches at the case and pulls off a panel to find a transmission device. Dalton not only knew about the police bugging the bank with the pizza boxes--he had bugged THEM first. He knows about the planned storming of the bank which has been in planning for many hours, and has had all that time to make preparations.Grabbing a microphone, he frantically warns Darius, insisting he and the ESU officers stand down, telling them about the transmitter and that Dalton heard everything that had been said in the MCC since the metal case was brought inside. But Darius refuses to stand down; he says he&#39;s going in--now.Inside the bank, Dalton pulls a small earpiece out of his ear and curses.Dalton alerts the three &#39;Stevens,&#39; who spring into action. Dalton starts laying smoke grenades as his colleagues gather all the hostages together out of the offices into the hallway, making sure they all have their hoods and masks on. Dalton shouts and waves his gun to herd the hostages upstairs, while Stevie and Steve-O are seen leaving their rifles in the offices, doffing their sunglasses for the hostage eye masks.The NYPD is about to begin their siege on the bank when suddenly the door is blown open with a small explosive. A few at a time, people in painter outfits, dark shades and masks begin running out, hands raised to shoulder level, pleading for the police not to shoot. Despite this, some officers open fire using the rubber bullets, until Captain Darius orders them to hold. All of the people are herded together and made to lie down on the ground. They are put in plasticuffs, and masks are removed... we see Stevie glancing around as she is cuffed, looking fearful; Steve lies with his face against the pavement beside Paul Guiterrez while Steve-O lies on his back, hands raised level with his head as he trembles anxiously.The ESU officers lead the way into the bank, efficiently making sure the bank is clear, room by room. Darius, Frazier and Mitchell enter and begin the investigation. Immediately they begin finding evidence that, just as Frazier had deduced, this was no ordinary robbery. First, they find all of the bank&#39;s money still in the vault. It appears untouched by the robbery crew. On a shelf in the cash vault is a bag with all the cell phones confiscated from the hostages. There are no booby traps or escape tunnels anywhere. Second, they find the rifles left behind by the three &#39;Stevens&#39; (so they could run out with the hostages and be indistinguisable from them) and realize that the firearms are not real--they are toys, carefully painted to look real, but cannot fire any actual ammunition. In the women&#39;s bathroom they find the white sack used to cover the head of the slain hostage--with a hidden injector tube of red dye; proof that the execution was staged, and nobody was actually harmed. In the supply room are plastic trash bags containing all the street clothes from the hostages.Outside, two police buses pull up and the officers there begin hustling all the hostages to their feet, putting them on a bus to be taken to the station for questioning. The bank guard is hostile and argumentative, and some other hostages try to cry in vain that they are not part of the robbery crew. Officers take each hostage&#39;s name and photograph them before putting them on the buses. Stevie gives her real name as Valerie Keepsake, and the Hasidic attorney/professor hostage gives his name as Chaim.Frazier and Coughlin meet in a conference room at their precinct HQ. Frazier gives the grim details at how thoroughly and flawlessly planned the whole affair was. Each hostage was shown photographs and questioned about anyone who stood out in any way. But every single hostage has at least a few people who would rule them out as suspicious. Even Stevie/Valerie, Steve/Kenneth, and Steve-O/Darius are vouched for by others, thanks to the time they spent posing as hostages, even causing a ruckus that required Dalton to come in and put them back in line. With no money missing from the bank--it has been re-counted several times and every last dollar is accounted for--it&#39;s like the whole thing never happened. They can&#39;t even find Dalton&#39;s .357 magnum (he was the only one of the robbery crew armed with a handgun) to see if it was real or fake like the rifles left behind.Coughlin tells Frazier to bury the case. Even though Frazier knows that somebody did SOMETHING throughout the whole situation, there was no robbery, no suspects, and nobody&#39;s breathing down Coughlin&#39;s neck to give answers, so he won&#39;t breathe down Frazier&#39;s. He restates his orders: bury the case.As Frazier gets up to leave, Coughlin gives him an afterthought: the missing money Frazier was accused of embezzling, has been found. He&#39;s off the hook. Frazier is pretty surprised, and not entirely in a pleasant manner. He asks Coughlin not to tell him where the money was found--he doesn&#39;t want to know.A safety deposit box number, 392, is briefly shown.Mitchell is rambling on about the people who had accused Frazier of wrongdoing or impropriety, and how they are the only ones still trying to find out anything about the robbery. Frazier is looking over a series of bank files, when suddenly he pauses. He&#39;s looking over a list of safety deposit boxes for the bank where the ordeal took place. The list skips from box 391 straight to box 393--box number 392 is not listed in the records. Grabbing his jacket, he tells Mitchell to come with him.Frazier is exiting a room in a courthouse, shaking a judge&#39;s hand and saying he&#39;ll be by tomorrow to pick up something that the judge will be providing him. As Frazier re-enters the atrium, he finds Madeline White waiting for him. She confronts him on his visiting a city judge and being told to bury the case, reminding him of their &#39;arrangement.&#39; But Frazier shows his trump card--a simple writing pen that officer Berk showed him, contained a hidden recording device. Frazier replays a recording when he was in the SUV with White and the mayor--he&#39;d had the pen in his suitcoat pocket. The recording has captured the Mayor ordering Frazier to give White everything she needed in the robbery or his career was finished; whether he was guilty of the drug money embezzlement or not.Frazier tries to press White about Arthur Case. He knows that Case is hiding something. White asks again for Frazier to leave everything be, but he leaves without answering her.White brazenly marches into an exclusive men&#39;s club to confront Case. She is addressing him by his first name now. She says that Frazier is &#39;under control,&#39; and that Dalton is holding onto the envelope Case was concerned about. White then informs Case on what she&#39;s learned from Dalton--that Case built his fortune doing business with the Nazis during World War II. Case doesn&#39;t deny the truth of it, saying he sold his soul and has spent his entire life trying to buy it back. White says that there appears to be no danger of Dalton using the envelope against Case immediately--he&#39;s hanging on to it as insurance in case he is ever caught and charged, and he might one day offer to sell it back to Case. But White knows that Dalton was not stopping at just stealing legal documents in order to sleep with them stuffed under his mattress.Case and White&#39;s voices both become curt and clipped as she confronts him on the fact that the robbers were after more than just the documents hidden in Case&#39;s safety box that contained the evidence of his crimes. She knows that he must have had true precious valuables, and there&#39;s only one thing they could be; one international currency of high monetary worth all over the world--what the Nazis used to pay Case: diamonds. And, as Case adds, there was a Cartier ring of incalculable worth that belonged to a wealthy Parisian Jewish banker and his family. Case could have saved their lives, but the Nazis gave him the ring to sell them out. Case writes White a check as payment for her services, and she leaves with an unpleasant remark about how she is going to list him as a reference in the sale of a Manhattan co-op to Osama Bin Laden&#39;s nephew (the man she was interviewing in her first scene).Dalton is seen repeating his opening monologue. He is in his &#39;cell,&#39; holding one of the black velvet pouches, looking at the diamonds inside it. He gathers a few belongings he has in his &#39;cell,&#39; turning out two small lights. He pushes out a wall in his cell, and it is revealed that he was never in prison, but in hiding--behind a false wall he and his cohorts had built in the bank supply room, with enough provisions to wait it out until all the brouhaha over the robbery had simmered down. Putting the section of false wall back in place and replacing the heavy boxes that were in front of it, He carefully but casually makes his way out into the public area of the bank.Across the street, Kenneth/Steve, Valerie/Stevie, and Darius/Steve-O are waiting, in an SUV. The camera pans along the SUV to show Chaim sitting with them--he was part of the heist all along; the mastermind behind it.They see Frazier and Mitchell going into the bank and hurriedly call Dalton on his cell phone to warn him. Dalton asks if they&#39;re coming for him, and they are not sure--it&#39;s just Frazier and Mitchell; nobody else.But Dalton is unafraid--he even goes so far to &#39;accidentally&#39; bump into Frazier as he and Mitchell enter the bank, apologizing to them as he continues on his way out, and they do not notice or recognize him. Dalton walks out of the bank and into the waiting van where he is greeted with a kiss from Valerie and handshakes from Kenneth, Darius and Chaim. When Chaim notes that Dalton doesn&#39;t have the ring with him, Dalton says he left it in the safety deposit box, but he assures Chaim it is in very good hands.As they all drive off, Case&#39;s diamonds and legal documents in their possession, and having escaped without so much as any suspicion on their heads, Dalton gives a closing monologue in that he did the robbery for the money, but speaks of how respect is the ultimate currency, and that he knows that Case, and other men like him, will always have to face their pasts sooner or later.Frazier and Mitchell present Peter Hammond with a warrant and court order authorizing them to open safety deposit box 392. Inside the box they are surprised and amused to find an unfinished package of Juicy Fruit gum, along with a few used gum wrappers... but they also find a jewelry box containing an exquisite gold and diamond ring, and the box has a Cartier label. There is also a small piece of scrap paper with the words &#39;Follow the ring&#39; scrawled on it.Frazier and Mitchell go to see Case at his office. What begins as a cordial conversation quickly degenerates into a heated confrontation as Frazier gradually reveals enough of what he&#39;s found during the investigation to show that he knows that Case hired Madeline White to keep Frazier reined in, and that Case himself is guilty of some serious crimes. He shows Case the ring, warning him that he is going to &#39;follow&#39; it. As he walks down the street with Mitchell after leaving the office, the two detectives share a laugh over how Frazier raked Case across the coals.Frazier goes to an exclusive diner where the mayor is having lunch with Madeline White. Frazier shows the mayor the ring and gives him a card with the phone number for a federal office responsible for prosecuting war crimes. He also gives White the pen with the incriminating recording he&#39;d used as leverage against her. After Frazier leaves, the mayor looks over the card, wondering what kind of problems White has gotten him into.Frazier arrives home in the evening. Walking past Sylvia&#39;s brother, who sleeps on a sofa in the living room, he goes into the bedroom where he is greeted by Sylvia. As he stores away his gun and shield, and his acknowledgement plaque for his promotion to First Grade, he realizes there is a small object in his suitcoat pocket. Reaching inside, he is stunned to find a small but beautifully cut diamond. He smiles to himself in amusement as he recalls his conversations with Dalton, and realizes that Dalton was the man who bumped into him at the bank entrance... just as Dalton said he would, he walked right out the door when he was &#39;good and ready.&#39; Moreover, as a sign of respect, he slipped the diamond to Frazier, so that the detective could now get a proper engagement ring made and propose to Sylvia.The movie closes with Sylvia calling Frazier to come to bed so they can make love.

It dodges a semi and some cars traveling down the road. Its luck runs out when it runs into the windshield of a van. The driver curses bugs and turns on the wipers to remove it. Several Hispanics are crowded into the back of the van. The van approaches a row of spotlights, and then the driver tells his passengers (in Spanish) to be quiet. It is a U.S. Border Patrol ambush. INS Agent Janus (Fredric Lehne) asks the driver, &#34;Nick the Slick&#34; (Jon Gries) where he&#39;s going and he replies, &#34;Fishin&#39; in Cuernavaca.&#34; They go to the back of the van to look at his &#34;catch&#34;. Janus orders all the Hispanics (in Spanish) to get out and form a line. He then asks Nick how much he got for each illegal alien, and then says that he should save it for his lawyer. A black car drives up and two men get out dressed in black suits. The driver, Agent K, &#34;Kay&#34;, (Tommy Lee Jones) identifies themselves as INS Division 6, which Janus never heard of. Kay asks his partner, Agent D, &#34;Dee&#34;, (Richard Hamilton), whom he&#39;s got his money on, and he says that it&#39;s a tough call. Kay walks up to each illegal and cordially asks them questions (in Spanish) such as &#34;How are you?&#34;, &#34;Going to Nogales?&#34;, and &#34;Looking for work?&#34;. He also tells them not to worry and welcomes them to the United States. When he reaches the last illegal, Kay confronts him, telling him (in Spanish) that he&#39;ll break his face and that he&#39;s very ugly, but the man just nods and grunts in agreement. Satisfied that the man doesn&#39;t speak any Spanish, Kay tells Dee that they have a winner, and tells the other illegals (in Spanish) that they can go. Janus tries to stop them, but Kay tells him that he doesn&#39;t know whom he&#39;s dealing with. The van drives away with all the illegals inside, except their &#34;winner&#34;, and then Kay tells the INS agents to leave.Kay and Dee take the man away from the road and Kay tells the INS agents to keep protecting them from dangerous aliens. Another INS agent tells Janus that there is no Division 6. Kay bets the man that he&#39;s not from anywhere near there, and pulls out a switchblade. He cuts open the front of the man, revealing &#34;Mikey&#34;, an extraterrestrial alien holding a fake human head. The alien roars and then speaks in his own language. Kay asks Mikey when they released him from jail. The alien complains, and Kay translates that he&#39;s a political refugee. Dee tells Mikey that he just violated seven treaties. Kay takes the head from Mikey, and then makes him raise his arms and flippers. Janus looks down from a hill and sees Mikey and then gasps. Mikey roars, pushes Dee down, and then charges at Janus. Kay tells Dee to shoot him, but Dee just fumbles with his gun. Like a deer frozen in car headlights, Janus stands petrified and screams even as Mikey leaps at him. Kay pulls out his gun and blasts Mikey dead, spraying blue guts all over Janus. Janus walks over to Kay and Dee in shock, stuttering as he tries to speak. The other INS agents rush over, and Kay assures them that everything is under control. A large black panel van pulls up. Several agents from a containment squad get out, holding flamethrowers and dressed in protective vinyl. Kay instructs them to perform a splay burn of the region to cover up any evidence of extraterrestrials. He then draws the INS agents&#39; attention to a small device with a red strobe light; he says that it&#39;s a neuralizer, a gift from &#34;some friends out of town&#34;, and that it will isolate memory impulses in their brains. As the INS agents lean forward for a better look, Janus asks Kay who he really is, and he tells them that he&#39;s just a figment of their imagination. Kay puts on his sunglasses and neuralizes the agents. He removes his sunglasses, and then tells the INS agents that they&#39;re lucky to be alive after that blast. Janus wonders what blast, and Kay claims that Janus discharged his gun and caused a gas main to explode.Kay walks over to Dee, who sits sullenly. Dee says that it didn&#39;t use to happen. He looks up at the stars and says that they&#39;re beautiful. Accepting his imminent retirement, he tells Kay that he&#39;ll miss the chase. Kay puts on his sunglasses, sets the neuralizer to 1961, and replies, &#34;No Dee, you won&#39;t&#34;, and then flashes the neuralizer.James Edwards (Will Smith), an undercover NYPD officer, runs after a suspect/perp (Keith Campbell) in the night. Two uniformed officers, very overweight, quit running with Edwards and &#34;let&#34; him continue the chase alone. The suspect jumps off a bridge about 20 feet high to the street below, and then continues running. Edwards is surprised at the man&#39;s agility, but he doesn&#39;t give up; he jumps onto a passing double-decker tourist bus, then runs out and onto the back of a New York Post delivery van. When the van catches up to the suspect, Edwards jumps out and slams him into a wall. The suspect says, &#34;He&#39;s coming! He&#39;s coming!&#34;, and then tries to shoot Edwards with an electronic weapon. Edwards knocks it to the ground and it vaporizes. The suspect takes off down the street again. They reach the Guggenheim Museum, and the suspect jumps about 15 feet onto the top of a wall, and then scales the side of a tall building onto the roof. Edwards shoots out the glass doors of the building entrance and then runs up a ramp. The suspect tries to open doors to leave the roof, finally finding one unlocked -- but finds Edwards there with his gun drawn. As the suspect backs up, he says, &#34;He&#39;s coming. He&#39;s coming because I failed, and he&#39;ll kill me too,&#34; then tells Edwards that his world is going to end. He blinks his corneas sideways like shutters. Edwards asks him, &#34;What the hell are you?&#34; The suspect backs up against the edge of the roof. Edwards asks him to come back from the ledge, that they will get his eyes fixed. The suspect throws himself off the roof, landing with a thud on the ground below and dying.At a bucolic farm in upstate New York, everything is peaceful except for the meteor that streaks towards it. Inside the house a man, Edgar (Vincent D&#39;Onofrio), is complaining to his wife Beatrice (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) that when he gets home from work he wants a clean house and a fat steak. He calls the dinner poison, but complains when his wife takes it away. He calls Beatrice useless, and then tells her, &#34;The only that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck.&#34; The meteor hits his pickup truck, obliterating it and setting a tree on fire. Edgar goes outside with his rifle to the meteor crater, and then an alien voice tells him to place his &#34;projectile weapon&#34; on the ground, Edgar replies, &#34;You can have my gun after you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.&#34; The alien accepts his proposal, and then pulls him screaming into the crater with its large insectoid claw. The alien eats him, and then climbs out of the crater wearing Edgar&#39;s skin and skull like a suit. &#34;Edgar&#34; staggers back into the house with the rifle. Beatrice asks him what that was, but he just asks for sugar. She puts a spoonful of sugar into a glass of water, but he asks for more sugar until she pours the whole bowl of sugar into the glass; he downs it and sighs contentedly. She tells him that his skin is hanging off his bones. He looks at the mirror, and agrees. He pulls back his scalp, tightening the skin on his face, and shows it to her; she faints. &#34;Edgar&#34; goes back outside and rolls his flying saucer out of the crater.Back at the police station, the police inspector and a cop who was with Edwards during the chase are questioning him about his report on the dead perp. They can&#39;t believe that the perpetrator blinked two sets of eyelids. Edwards says that it was after the weapon &#34;evaporated into a million pieces.&#34; The officer asks him why no other officer saw these events, and Edwards replies that they are &#34;a little soggy around the midsection and couldn&#39;t keep up.&#34; Edwards and the cop then argue, so the inspector takes the cop out of the room to talk. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino), Deputy Medical Examiner, comes in and tells Edwards that she believes him. She tells him to find her at the morgue on 26th and then leaves. We see Kay zap her with the neuralizer in the hallway then comes into the room. He unplugs the camera and then tells Edwards that those were gills, not eyes; the suspect was out of breath. Edwards asks Kay who he is. He doesn&#39;t answer, but instead asks Edwards if the suspect said anything. Edwards replies that he said the world was coming to an end. Kay asks if he said when, but Edwards just stares at him. Kay asks if he would recognize his weapon, and Edwards says, &#34;Absolutely.&#34; Kay takes Edwards out of the room for &#34;a ride&#34;, but he complains about the paperwork he has to complete. Kay tells him that its done. When Kay opens the door, the inspector comes by holding some paperwork and congratulates Edwards on &#34;running down the dude on foot.&#34;Kay drives Edwards while explaining that he&#39;s part of a bureau that licenses, monitors, and polices alien activity on the planet Earth; Edwards scoffs. They arrive at a pawnshop owned by Jack Jeebs, who Edwards says doesn&#39;t even sell guns. Edwards tells Kay to wait while he goes inside. Inside the shop, Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) is examining some stolen Rolex watches on the counter, and jokes to Edwards about returning them. Edwards tells Jeebs that he&#39;s into something hotter than them, then asks him about unusual guns. Kay comes inside, holding his gun and tells Jeebs to show Edwards the imports. Jeebs claims he got out of that business. Kay tells him that he hates it when he lies, then points his gun at Jeebs and counts to three. On three, Kay shoots Jeebs, causing his head to blow off. Edwards points his own gun at Kay and orders him to drop his weapon and put his hands on his head, when suddenly Jeebs stands up, having grown a new head! He presses a button hidden under the counter and then several panels swing open, revealing alien weapons. Edwards identifies the weapon the perp pulled on him. Kay rebukes Jeebs for selling &#34;a reverberating carbonizer with mutating capacity to an unlicensed cephalopoid.&#34; Kay says that it must have been for assassination, and asks Jeebs who&#39;s the target. Kay points his gun at Jeebs, who then says in desperation that he doesn&#39;t know. Kay tells Jeebs that he&#39;s going to confiscate all of it and wants Jeebs on the next transport off Earth or he will shoot him again. Kay and Edwards leave. Outside, two people on a tandem bicycle ride by, their clothing covered with lights. Kay tells Edwards that he can&#39;t help him get a handle on the moment, but says that the only comfort he can offer is his promise that tomorrow morning Edwards wont remember a thing. Edwards remarks that it&#39;s not exactly some stuff you just forget, then Kay zaps Edwards with the neuralizer.Later, in a Chinese restaurant, Kay is telling Edwards some jokes. Kay looks at his watch then gets up to go. Edwards asks who he is, and Kay gives him his business card, to see him at 9:00. Kay leaves, and Edwards looks at the card, which shows &#34;MiB&#34; embossed on one side and &#34;504 Battery Drive&#34; printed on the other side.A Zap-EM exterminator truck pulls up to a building. The exterminator opens the building door, and roaches scurry everywhere. He has a gas canister on his back with hoses attached and a gas mask pulled over his forehead. He tells Edgar that he has a pest problem. Edgar then refers to people as the infestation, &#34;nothing but an undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum, totally convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short pointless lives.&#34; Edgar then grabs the exterminator and kills him by forcing his gas pipe down his mouth. The man falls to the floor, dead, gas pouring out of his mouth. Edgar rolls the saucer into the back of the truck.Edwards arrives at the MiB building and shows the card to the guard, who sends him to the elevator. Upstairs, Edwards doesn&#39;t notice that the elevator&#39;s back doors open until MiB chief agent Zed (Rip Torn) tells him that he&#39;s late. Five other men in military uniforms are already sitting there, and Edwards sits in the last chair. Zed tells them that they are there because they&#39;re the best of the best and MiB is looking for just one of them. Zed tells them he will give them some simple tests on motor skills, concentration, and stamina. Edwards raises his hand and asks why they&#39;re here, even though Zed already told them. 2nd Lt. Jake Jensen (Kent Faulcon) raises his hand and Zed motions to him to stand. Standing stiffly, he recites what Zed told them. Zed nods and he sits back down. Edwards chuckles then mocks Jensen and calls him &#34;Captain America.&#34; Zed scowls at Edwards, and the others stare at him. Kay watches on the other side of a two-way mirror.They start the written exam. In this one, Edwards breaks his pencil and tears the cover of his notebook as he tries to open it. All the men struggle to write in their awkward egg-shaped chairs, poking holes in the paper. Edwards puts down his notebook and pencil then drags the metal table from the center of the room to bring it next to his chair. The table makes a horrible scraping sound and the other men stop writing. Happy now, Edwards retrieves his notebook and pencil and asks the others if they want to use the table too.The next test is a dark target range; a strobe light flashes, and cardboard alien figures move in front of the men. The other recruits shoot at every alien figure moving by, but Edwards waits, then fires a single shot. Zed stops the test and then with the remote brings the target forward that Edwards shot -- a little girl holding school books; he asks Edwards why he thought &#34;little Tiffany deserved to die.&#34; Edwards tells Zed that she&#39;s the only one who seemed dangerous and explains his logic: target 1, which was hanging from a street light, was just working out; another one was snarling, but had a tissue in his hand -- he&#39;s sneezing not snarling; then he saw &#34;little Tiffany -- 8-year-old white girl middle of the night in the ghetto among a bunch of monsters, reading quantum physics, and those books are way too advanced for her -- she&#39;s up to something.&#34; Zed just shakes his head and walks out. Edwards asks the others if it was a good shot. They shake their heads in disgust. Zed tells Kay that Edwards has a problem with authority; Kay replies that so does he (Kay), but Edwards ran down a cephalopoid on foot, which is tough. Zed hopes that Kay knows what he&#39;s doing.Zed comes back into the room, and congratulates the men, telling then that they&#39;re everything MiB could expect from years of government training. He tells them to follow him for one more test -- an eye exam. They put down their pistols and follow him.Edwards is the last one out. Kay stops him then hands him a folder and they walk down the hallway. Kay explains that in the 1950s the government established an agency to establish contact with races from other planets; they were surprised when aliens actually did contact them. Kay and Edwards pass a room, where Zed is administering the &#34;eye exam&#34; to the others with a neuralizer. The neuralizer flashes as Kay and Edwards continue down the hallway. Edwards opens the folder and sees a photo of an alien standing at the door of an alien spacecraft. Kay explains: in the mid-1950s, the government started an under funded agency to establish contact with races from other planets; aliens made contact on March 2, 1961. &#34;There were nine of us the first night: seven agents, an astronomer, and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road.&#34; One photo shows agents by an old pickup truck and its driver (who looks like Kay) standing by the front; the next one shows the pickup driver giving a tall alien some flowers as the agents look on. Edwards turns the page to the next photo, two disks atop towers. Edwards says, &#34;Uh-huh, so, these were real flying saucers, and the World&#39;s Fair was just a cover-up?&#34; Kay replies, &#34;Why else would we hold it in Queens?&#34; Edwards suggests that Kay get a CAT scan, then asks to be let out. Kay asks Edwards if he wants any coffee then opens the door to the break room, revealing four worm-like aliens with long legs drinking coffee. Edwards stares in shock as a worm pours coffee for Kay. Kay asks Edwards again if he wants coffee, but he just stutters, speechless.Kay and Edwards sit on a bench by the waterfront. Kay tells Edwards that there are about 1500 aliens on the planet, and most of them are there in Manhattan. Most of them are decent enough, and are trying to make a living. Kay says that humans are for the most part clueless, and are happy not knowing about these things. Edwards asks why they keep it a secret, that people are smart and can handle it. Kay replies that a person is smart, but people are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. He tells Edwards that 1500 years ago, everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe; 500 years ago everybody knew the Earth was flat; and 15 minutes ago Edwards knew that people were alone on this planet. Kay sighs and says, &#34;Imagine what you&#39;ll know...tomorrow.&#34; Edwards asks him what&#39;s the catch. Kay replies that the catch is he has to sever every human contact and no one will ever know he exists anywhere, ever. Edwards asks if it&#39;s worth it, and Kay says it is if he&#39;s strong enough. He gives Edwards until sunrise to think it over, and leaves. Edwards sits there until night.At MiB headquarters, Edwards enters the elevator as Kay waits for him. Edwards says that he&#39;s in. He tells Kay that they chose him because they recognized his skills, and not to call him son or kid or sport. Kay replies that his skills now mean precisely nothing. The elevator&#39;s back doors open, revealing a large bay: Earth customs.As Kay and Edwards walk, a customs agent asks a tall alien (Carel Struycken) if he has any fruits or vegetables, and he states that he&#39;s on a diplomatic mission. Edwards asks Kay what branch of the government they report to. Kay replies that there is none, because they ask too many questions. Edwards asks who pays for all of this. Kay tells him that they hold patents on some gadgets they confiscated from out-of-state visitors, such as Velcro, microwave oven, and liposuction. Kay and Edwards enter a room filled with alien technology. Kay shows him a small disk about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. Kay says that it will replace CDs soon, and he will have to buy the &#34;White&#34; album again. He then shows Edwards a universal translator. Edwards notices a sphere about the size of a golf ball floating in air a couple of inches above a metal stand. He reaches for it and knocks it away. The energetic sphere flies quickly out the door into the customs bay, hitting many things as it speeds away. People dodge as the sphere ricochets off walls, hits lamps and other things, then destroys a lab. Finally Kay catches it with a special mitt. As Kay puts the sphere back at its stand, he tells Edwards that it caused the 1977 New York City blackout (as a type of prank), then places the mitt next to the stand.Kay tells Edwards that observation is the heart of their endeavor. He introduces Edwards to two multi-armed aliens: &#34;the twins&#34;, &#34;Blblup&#34; and Bob. The twins sit at a control panel; the map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth; some of them are under constant surveillance. (Two of the aliens displayed are Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone.) Edwards remarks that it makes sense, because when he was in third grade he knew his teacher had to be from Venus or someplace like that.Zed interrupts them and tells Edwards to put &#34;it&#34; on: the last suit he will ever wear. Kay uses the computer to delete all of Edwards personal information, such as birth certificate, driver&#39;s license, etc. As Zed narrates, Edwards goes to his locker, labeled &#34;J&#34;, and then gets dressed: &#34;You will dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MiB special services. You&#39;ll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you.&#34; Edwards puts his hands on a metal sphere. The sphere scans his fingerprints and burns them off; he recoils in pain. Zed continues: &#34;From now on, you&#39;ll have no identifying marks of any kind, you will not stand out in any way. Your entire image is crafted to leave no lasting memory with anybody you encounter. You are a rumor, recognizable only as déjà vu, and dismissed just as quickly. You don&#39;t exist. You were never even born. Anonymity is your name, silence your native tongue. You are no longer part of the system. You are above the system. Over it. Beyond it. We&#39;re &#39;Them&#39;. We&#39;re &#39;They&#39;. We are the Men in Black.&#34; Kay updates the database with Edwards&#39; new name: J. As J, &#34;Jay&#34;, puts on his sunglasses, he tells Kay that the difference between them is that &#34;I make this look good.&#34;G. Rosenberg (Mike Nussbaum) leaves his jewelry store, carrying his pet cat in a bag, and a small metal case. Edgar drives by the store and then adjusts his stiff joints as he observes Rosenberg. After Rosenberg locks the doors, Edgar drives away.Zed briefs Kay and Jay on the status of some aliens as they watch a monitor. He tells them they had an unauthorized landing in upstate New York. Suddenly the alarm sounds below them: a boundary violation. Zed tells them that it&#39;s an alien named Redgick; he&#39;s not cleared to leave Manhattan, and is stuck in gridlock on the New Jersey turnpike. He tells Kay to take Jay with him so he can warm up on something. Jay mocks Zed as they walk to Kay&#39;s car. Jay complains that even though they have unlimited technology from the whole universe, they cruise around in a Ford P.O.S. They get in the car and Kay tells Jay to fasten his seat belt, but he doesn&#39;t. Jay tells Kay that he has to work on his people skills, that he would get a better reaction if he were a little more polite. Kay then asks him to please fasten his seat belt, and then drives away, the car racing like a dragster. Jay gets slammed around violently. Jay holds onto a lever protruding between the seats. Kay tells him to never press the red button on it, and Jay quickly lets go. They race down the road.A taxi drops Rosenberg off at a restaurant. Edgar stops next to them, then drives away. Rosenberg enters the restaurant and sits with a tall humanoid alien, the one who Kay and Jay saw at Earth customs. Speaking in an alien language, Rosenberg tells the diplomat that he&#39;s late because of the cab driver. The diplomat calls Rosenberg &#34;Your Majesty&#34; and tells him that he&#39;s in grave danger. He says that a bug landed there and they have to get him off the planet. They both agree that the bug knows why Rosenberg is there. The diplomat thinks he recognizes the device (the metal case), but Rosenberg says that it&#39;s diamonds for the diplomat&#39;s children. The short-order cook says that their order is up, then wonders where Ivan is. Edgar says that he gave him a break. He takes the two plates to the table, passing Ivan, who is dead and stuffed between two shelves. The diplomat toasts to the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire. Rosenberg toasts to the safety of the galaxy. Edgar puts their plates down on the table, and then roaches come out of his sleeves onto the plates. Rosenberg looks up in fear, and then tells Edgar that he can kill them both but won&#39;t find the galaxy. The cat looks out of the bag. The word Orion is on its collar, and something hangs from it. Edgar tells Rosenberg that he&#39;s right about one thing. He kills the Arquillians, and then takes the case and rushes outside.Kay stops a car, asking Reggie Redgick (Patrick Breen) for his license and registration as Jay looks on. Reggie shows Kay his driver&#39;s license and registration, then Kay asks for his other license and registration, which he then shows to Kay. Kay tells him that his resident alien card restricts him to the five boroughs. Kay asks Reggie where he&#39;s going, and then Kay and Jay see his wife in labor on the back seat. Kay takes Reggie back to the Ford, and tells Jay to handle the birth. Jay complains, but Kay tells him that it&#39;s easy and to just catch. Kay reassures Reggie that Jay does it all the time. Jay stands by the car and tries to coach the wife with her breathing. A tentacle comes out of the car and grabs Jay as Kay interrogates Reggie normally, completely oblivious to Jay&#39;s dilemna. Kay asks Reggie why he&#39;s heading out of town when Croagg the midwife is at 54th and Madison. Reggie tells Kay that they&#39;re meeting someone at a ship. Kay tells Reggie that he&#39;s not cleared for departure. Reggie replies that it&#39;s an emergency. As the tentacle waves Jay around high in the air, Kay reassures him that he&#39;s doing fine. The tentacle pulls Jay into the car then out on the opposite side. Kay asks Reggie why he&#39;s so eager to get off the planet, and he replies that they don&#39;t like the neighborhood because of some of the new arrivals. The tentacle slams Jay against the roof of the car, and then pulls him back in. Kay asks Reggie if it is related to the crasher from last night. Jay flies out of the car onto the grass, holding the tentacled alien baby. Kay congratulates Reggie on his... &#34;squid&#34;, and gives him back his resident alien card. Jay says that the baby is cute, but it spits up on him while he speaks. Back in Kay&#39;s car, slime drips off Jay. Kay asks him if anything about that seemed unusual to him. Jay just turns and looks at him. Kay wonders what would scare Reggie enough that he would risk a warp drive with a newborn, and tells Edwards that he&#39;s going to check the &#34;hot sheets.&#34;Kay and Jay go to a newsstand, and Kay buys several tabloids. Jay can&#39;t believe this, but Kay calls them the best investigative reporting on the planet. He says that Jay could get lucky if he read The New York Times, then shows him the cover story of The World: &#34;ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND&#39;S SKIN!&#34;Kay and Jay drive to Beatrice&#39;s farm, posing as FBI agents who want to talk to her about her visitor. He assures her that they&#39;re not there to make fun of her, and she lets them in and gives them lemonade. She tells them that the chief of police made a full investigation and took a report, writing down everything she said; he didn&#39;t believe her, but instead made fun of her. She says that the chief asked how could Edgar walk back in the house if he was murdered, but she didn&#39;t know. She says that she knew it wasn&#39;t Edgar; it was like something was wearing Edgar, like a suit. Jay shows Kay a photo of Edgar, saying that he was that ugly before he was an alien. Beatrice says that when she woke up, he was gone. Kay asks her if he said anything, and she replies that he asked for sugar water. Kay signals for Jay to put on his sunglasses and then Kay zaps her with the neuralizer. He tells her that there was no alien; the flash of light she saw in the sky was not a UFO; swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and it refracted the light from Venus. Jay can&#39;t believe that Kay could do that and give her another memory, and that&#39;s the best he could come up with. Kay continues adding to her fake memory, saying that Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend, and that Beatrice should go to her mother&#39;s for a couple of nights. Jay adds that he never appreciated her anyway; that she kicked him out; and that she should go to Bloomingdale&#39;s. He finishes with telling her to hire a decorator. Outside, Kay scoops up some dirt from the crater into a pocket analyzer. Jay asks Kay when he&#39;s getting his own &#34;flashy little memory messer-upper thingy&#34; (neuralizer); Kay replies that he will when he grows up. The analyzer&#39;s green light comes on, and Kay asks Jay if he knows what kind of alien life leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water. Jay jokes that it was on &#34;Final Jeopardy&#34; last night. Kay calls Zed and informs him that they have a bug. Jay wonders how that&#39;s bad. Kay explains that bugs thrive on carnage -- they consume, infest, destroy, and live off the death and destruction of other species. Kay tells him to imagine &#34;a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper... is terror-assing around Manhattan in a brand new Edgar suit.&#34; Kay tells Jay that they have to watch the morgues.A cop wheels Rosenberg&#39;s corpse into the morgue; Rosenberg&#39;s cat sits on top. The medical examiner, Laurel Weaver, takes the corpse to the back and performs an autopsy on it. The other dead Arquillian is at the freezers. She looks in disbelief at his insides, and asks him what he is. Kay and Jay enter the morgue building. Weaver dictates her findings into a recorder (paraphrased): &#34;The subject&#39;s temperature rose up to 112° at the time of autopsy; when I tried to verify this rectally, I found that he didn&#39;t have a rectum, which is...&#34; Kay finishes for her with, &#34;Weird.&#34; He introduces himself as Dr. Leo Manville, Department of Public Health, and Jay as Dr. White. Kay asks her if she has anything unusual there. She replies that it&#39;s a triple homicide; the first body she opened was normal, except that it was broken in half. She shows them the tall Arquillian. She says that he has a skeletal structure unlike anything she saw before. Kay says that he&#39;ll look at it, and then Weaver takes Jay to look at the other one (Rosenberg), which she says is even stranger. With gloves on, Weaver and Jay explore his insides. She asks him if he notices anything strange -- stomach, liver, and lungs. He says that they&#39;re all fine, but she tells him they are all missing. He makes up a lame explanation for his examination. She asks if they met before, and says she has a strange feeling of déjà vu; Jay says that he does too. She tells Jay not to tell &#34;the other guy&#34; (Kay) that she thinks the body is not really a body but is a transport unit for something else. She starts to tell him what she likes to do sometimes &#34;when it&#39;s really late&#34;, but Kay calls him over. Looking at the dead tall alien, Kay asks Jay what he thinks, but Jay mistakenly talks about Weaver and her body. Kay tells him,&#34; the dead body,&#34; and Jay says that Kay should look at the other one. Jay recognizes the tall alien from headquarters. Kay asks him what killed the alien; Jay correctly answers that a bug did. Weaver calls Jay back. She shows him wires protruding from one of Rosenberg&#39;s ears. Jay pulls on the ear lobe; the ears eject, and high-pressure air vents from them. The face swings open to reveal a tiny alien inside the skull, seated at a control console surrounded by lights. The tiny alien draws in labored breaths and says, &#34;Must...to prevent...contest.&#34; Jay and Weaver coach the alien into saying the right words: &#34;To prevent war.&#34; They help the alien finish his sentence: &#34;The galaxy is on Orion&#39;s belt.&#34; The alien dies and then the lights inside the skull turn off. Jay wonders what it means and calls Kay, &#34;Doctor whatever&#34; over. Weaver realizes that they aren&#39;t from the Department of Health. Kay says, &#34;Rosenberg.&#34; He sees the open skull and says that the Arquillians won&#39;t like it because he was from the royal family. Weaver declares that it&#39;s an alien, and Kay and Jay are government agents hiding the facts. Jay tells Kay what the alien said: &#34;To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion&#39;s belt.&#34; Kay puts on his sunglasses, prompting Jay to puts his on too. Kay zaps Weaver with the neuralizer. Kay says that it doesn&#39;t make sense. Weaver recovers and asks for their ID, and Kay zaps her with the neuralizer again. Jay thinks it will give her brain cancer. Kay tells Jay that they have to leave and close all the doors because Special Services will be there soon. As they leave, Jay asks Kay if he zapped him with it, and Kay tells him no. Jay asks to be in charge of the neuralizer, but Kay says no. They pass two MiB Special Services men outside, and Kay briefs them on the situation. After Jay complains, Kay tells them to give Weaver a happy memory.In a back alley somewhere, Edgar struggles violently in the Zap-Em truck to open the Arquillian&#39;s case. He finally breaks it open, spilling diamonds on the floor. He growls in frustration, &#34;Where is it?&#34;Kay and Jay return to MiB headquarters. Kay uses the satellite to locate and zoom in on his wife he had before he joined MiB. Meanwhile, Jay asks Zed if anyone there ever gets any sleep. Zed replies that &#34;the twins&#34; keep them on Centaurian time, a 37-hour day. Zed tells Jay that he will get used to it in a few months, or have a psychotic episode. Pointing to a large display, Zed shows Jay where Orion is. He explains that Orion&#39;s belt is only 3 stars, not a galaxy, and that there are no galaxies on Orion&#39;s belt. Zed tells Jay that he heard wrong, but Jay insists that he heard it correctly and leaves. As Kay freezes the image of his wife on the monitor, Jay calls her pretty, and Kay clears the screen. Jay correctly concludes that Kay was the person giving flowers to the tall alien in the photograph; his wife never got them and she never remarried. Zed calls Kay over to look at the twins&#39; display: all the aliens are leaving the United States. Jay wonders why, and Kay compares it to rats deserting a ship. Kay uses a satellite to locate an Arquillian battle cruiser in space. Zed says they (MiB) have a dead Arquillian prince. The Arquillian ship sends a message, and Zed tells the twins to translate it. He then sends Kay and Jay to Rosenberg&#39;s jewelry store to try to find information. As they leave, Zed tells Kay to give Jay a weapon.At the armory, Kay takes a &#34;Series 4 De-atomizer&#34;. Jay thinks it&#39;s for him, but Kay gives him a very small pistol -- a &#34;Noisy Cricket&#34;. Jay complains, calling it a midget cricket and waves it around, but Kay grabs his arm and stops him. As they leave, Jay tells Kay that he might break it.Edgar parks across the street from Rosenberg&#39;s jewelry store and breaks in. He smashes all the jewelry cases, looking for the missing galaxy. Outside, a tow truck driver hooks up the Zap-Em truck. Edgar sees a photo of Rosenberg holding his cat. He also sees another photo of the cat, and focuses on the spherical object hanging from its collar. Edgar goes outside and tries to stop the driver from towing the truck. Kay and Jay arrive at the store and see the mess. Jay wonders who would do that but not take the jewelry; Kay tells him that it&#39;s someone who wasn&#39;t looking for jewelry. Jay sees the photos and remarks that Rosenberg &#34;had a serious crush on his cat.&#34; Edgar shoots the tow truck driver. Jay shoots at Edgar. The blast throws Jay against a wall and destroys the storefront. Jay runs outside and shoots at Edgar again as he drives away in the tow truck. The blast disconnects the Zap-Em truck and throws Jay into some trash bags and cans. Jay stands on a car and shoots again at the tow truck as it turns the corner. He misses, blowing a giant hole in a tractor-trailer. The recoil throws Jay onto a car&#39;s windshield. Kay pulls him off and tells him that they don&#39;t discharge their weapons in view of the public. Jay reminds Kay that the alien ship is about to... Kay interrupts him, saying that there&#39;s always an alien emergency on Earth; the only way people remain happy is because they don&#39;t know about it. Kay tells Jay that the bug isn&#39;t leaving because they have his ship. Jay goes to the Zap-Em truck and pulls people out of it. Kay calls Zed for a containment crew, but Zed replies that it&#39;s a moot point because the exodus continues. The monitor at MiB shows the translation of the Arquillian message: &#34;MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY&#34;. Zed sees the worm aliens leaving and shouts at them, calling them sorry little ingrates. They are leaving with their luggage and 5 cases of Marlboro cigarettes. They tell him off in their language and laugh. Zed tells Kay that they&#39;ve only translated part of the message, but the Arquillians hold MiB responsible.Edgar gets out of the truck. A street vendor sits next to his wares: various bug-killing devices such as fly swatters, Combat, and Raid bug spray. Edgar asks the man where he keeps his dead, who says that he doesn&#39;t have any dead. Edgar chokes him, so the man says that they&#39;re at the city morgue. Edgar knocks over one of his stands and takes some postcards, and then he leaves.Jay is trying to give a normal explanation to the crowd for what just happened, but Kay calls him over. Kay tells Jay that the Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever that means. He says that they need some help from a professional, someone who has years of experience in intergalactic politics. Kay hopes that &#34;the little twerp hasn&#39;t skipped town.&#34; A man from MiB Special Services announces on a loud speaker for the crowd to gather around and look at his neuralizer.Kay and Jay stop at a locksmith&#39;s shop. Jay thinks that the creepy-looking owner is an alien in disguise, but his pet pug speaks, telling Jay, &#34;If you don&#39;t like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.&#34; Kay talks to the dog, Frank (voiced by Tim Blaney), who says that he&#39;s busy. Kay grabs Frank, and threatens to call the pound. Jay tells a passing man that the dog owes his friend some money. Kay asks Frank what he knows about Arquillians and bugs, but he pretends he doesn&#39;t know. Kay shakes him, then Frank says that Rosenberg wasn&#39;t an ordinary Arquillian; he was the guardian of a whole galaxy; they thought he would be safe on Earth. Frank says that the galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe; if the bugs get it, the Arquillians are doomed. Kay asks Frank about a galaxy on Orion&#39;s belt. Frank pretends he doesn&#39;t know, until Kay shakes him again. Some people have gathered across the street. Jay tells them that they&#39;re rehearsing for a ventriloquist act. Frank finally says that the galaxy is here. Jay replies that a galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets; how could it be here? Frank tells them that size doesn&#39;t matter; just because something is important doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not very small. Kay shakes him and asks him how small. Frank replies that it&#39;s tiny, like the size of a marble or jewel. Frank says that he has to be walked before his flight, so Kay lets him down and he runs away. Kay tells Jay that if the galaxy&#39;s there, it&#39;s not on Orion&#39;s belt. Frank stops to bark at a cat up on a ledge with a bell on its collar. Jay sees the cat and realizes what Orion is; he calls Kay.At the morgue, the cat runs across the floor then jumps onto Laurel Weaver&#39;s desk, startling her. She reads the collar and says that Orion is a pretty name, and then grabs the small spherical object hanging from the cat&#39;s collar. She says, &#34;Wow&#34; when she notices the galaxy rotating in the sphere, then stares at it, mesmerized at the galaxy as it reflects brightly in her eyes.Edgar goes to the morgue and sets his rifle down. He rings the bell several times, and then Orion hisses and runs away. The morgue attendant (David Cross) comes to the desk and berates him for ringing the bell too much. Edgar asks to see his dead friend and the cat he gave him; he wants the cat back. The attendant asks for proof of ownership, relationship to the deceased, etc. Edgar gets upset when the man swats some flies. Several roaches crawl out of Edgar&#39;s sleeve, so the man gets some bug spray. Edgar stares angrily and growls at the man, and he trembles in fear.Kay and Jay arrive at the morgue. Jay says that he wants to handle it, because he doesn&#39;t want Kay to zap Laurel with the neuralizer again and give her brain damage. Kay gives him two minutes. Inside, Edgar throws Laurel against the freezers and Orion hides. Edgar asks her where the cat is, but she doesn&#39;t know. He drags her across the floor, looking for the cat, but stops when Jay rings the bell and calls out. Jay gives up when no one comes over, so he goes inside. He finds Laurel behind a cart and tells her that he&#39;s Sergeant Friday from the 26th precinct. He asks her if she saw a cat that came in with a corpse; the cat&#39;s nametag said Orion. She replies that she did. Jay tells her that he needs to take the cat because it&#39;s a witness in a murder case and he&#39;ll ask it some questions. She says that she doesn&#39;t know where it is right now. He&#39;s surprised, but she coyly asks him to take her instead. Jay flirts with her, unaware that Edgar is hiding under the cart. Kay enters the morgue building, looks around, and then looks at his watch. Laurel points down, saying that she needs to show him something. Jay misunderstands her double entendre, saying that she&#39;s going too fast. He flirts with her some more. Kay lights a match to smoke a cigarette, but ooze drips from the ceiling and puts it out. He looks up and sees the attendant stuck to the ceiling, along with the bug spray and some papers. Laurel repeats her request, backing up and pointing, and Jay finally understands and draws his weapon. Orion jumps onto the cart, and Edgar grabs the cat and hides behind Laurel. Kay bursts in and joins Jay, pointing his weapon at Edgar. Laurel calls Jay thick, and they argue. Edgar tells her to shut up. He tells them that compared to them, he&#39;s on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder. Kay and Jay back him up towards a wall. Kay asks him how far he&#39;ll get without his ship. Edgar jumps with Laurel through a window up to street level. Kay and Jay run to catch up with them. Edgar hijacks a taxi, kicking the driver out with his prayer rug. He tells Laurel to take him to the place on a postcard he holds up (the World&#39;s Fair), but she refuses. She floors it when bugs climb out of his mouth. Edgar swallows the galaxy. When Kay and Jay get outside, Jay sees the prayer rug and tells Kay that Edgar is in a cab then runs after them. Jay comes around the corner and sees many taxi cabs stopped at a signal. He points his weapon at the people in one, but it&#39;s not the right taxi, so he walks away in frustration. Kay drives up and picks up Jay and then they drive away.At MiB headquarters, Kay tells a man to put up a bio-net around Manhattan. The Arquillians fire a warning shot at the North Pole. Kay tells Jay that it&#39;s Arquillian battle rules: after the ultimatum they fire a warning shot and give Earth a galactic standard week to respond -- one hour. The screen shows the fully translated message: &#34;MIB: DELIVER THE GALAXY OR EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED. SORRY&#34;. Kay tells Jay that to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy that galaxy. Zed adds, &#34;and whatever planet it&#39;s on.&#34; As Kay and Zed speculate on the ships that Edgar would try to take, Jay shouts to the &#34;old guys&#34; and calls their attention. Everyone stops and turns as Jay asks them if &#34;those&#34; still work, referring to the towers at the World&#39;s Fair.Laurel and Edgar arrive at the World&#39;s Fair. He tells her that he took her with him because he needs &#34;a snack&#34; for the long trip. Kay and Jay drive to Queens, but Jay says that the tunnel will be packed. They enter the tunnel and Kay tells him to press the red button. The car transforms into a jet car and Kay tells Jay to put on his seat belt, but he doesn&#39;t (again). Jay screams as the car speeds towards traffic, then climbs a wall and flies upside down. Jay gets slammed against the roof of the car. Kay puts an 8-track tape in the player for music to help Jay relax: Elvis Presley singing &#34;Promised Land&#34;. As Jay struggles to find a more comfortable position, Kay sings along with Elvis. They dodge a sign on a truck then climb down the wall, landing on the road outside the other end of the tunnel.Edgar climbs a ladder on one of the towers, holding Laurel. She tells him that he wouldn&#39;t want to eat her because she&#39;s a very important person, like a queen or a goddess, and it could start a war. He replies that it&#39;s good, and will mean more food for his family -- all 78 million of them. Laurel jumps into a tree so he lets her go. When he reaches the top, he opens a panel in the saucer and enters it. Kay and Jay pull up. Kay takes two large weapons from the trunk and gives one to Jay. Kay says, &#34;Roaches check in,&#34; and Jay finishes, &#34;but they don&#39;t check out.&#34; They walk to the tower.The saucer halves close and it lifts off the tower. It flies over Shea Stadium, where the Mets are playing. An outfielder becomes mesmerized by the saucer, and a fly ball beans him. Kay and Jay shoot the saucer with their pulse rifles and it explodes into flames. It flies out of control and crashes through the Unisphere, stopping a few feet in front of them. The door opens and Edgar staggers towards them, barely recognizable. Kay tells Edgar that he&#39;s under arrest for violating the Tycho treaty. Jay orders him to turn over the galaxy, step away from the vehicle, and put his hands on his head. Edgar puts his hands on his head, but then rips off his skin and head, revealing his true form: a giant monstrous cockroach. The bug snarls and eats their weapons then knocks them to the ground, roaring. Kay gets back up, telling Jay to keep the bug from getting on the second ship and to keep him on Earth. Kay tells Jay that he&#39;s going to get his gun back, and Jay gets up. Kay confronts the bug, calling him a slimy, gut-sucking intestinal parasite. He shouts at the bug to eat him, and it does, roaring and swallowing him whole. It roars again and walks to the second tower. Telling the bug that it forgot dessert, Jay throws a large rock at its head. He tries repeatedly to stop it, but it keeps knocking him down. The bug starts climbing the tower, but Jay grabs its hind end. It shakes him loose, throwing him against a dumpster. Laurel falls to the ground and hides. Jay gets up and tries to goad the bug into fighting some more, but he notices cockroaches on his sleeve. He kicks open the rusty dumpster and many more roaches spill out. He purposely steps on a cockroach and the giant bug stops. Jay taunts the bug, calling some roaches his aunt and uncle. He steps on another one and the giant bug jumps back down off the ladder. Jay continues to step on roaches as the bug walks towards him. Jay tells the bug to ease off of his face before something bad happens to him. Kay&#39;s weapon whines and the bug looks at its gut before Kay blasts it in two. Kay lands next to Jay; both of them are covered in slime. Jay picks up the galaxy off the ground, and Kay calls Zed and tells him to inform the Arquillians. They don&#39;t notice movement behind them. Jay tells Kay that while he was in there playing around, he was doing all the work. Jay tells Kay what he did and gives the galaxy to Kay. Kay tells him that he should have been there for the 1968 Zeronian migration, but then realizes that Jay wasn&#39;t even alive then. The giant bug isn&#39;t dead yet, and rises up to eat Jay, but someone blasts it with a pulse rifle, killing it. They turn around and see Laurel holding the rifle.Kay and Jay have cleaned up and returned to MiB headquarters, standing outside. Laurel waits by the car. Kay takes out his neuralizer, but Jay complains that she helped them. Kay says it&#39;s not for her; it&#39;s for himself. Kay looks up at the stars and tells Jay that he never looks at them anymore and that they&#39;re beautiful. He tells Jay that he hasn&#39;t been training a partner; he&#39;s been training a replacement. Jay complains that he can&#39;t do this job alone. Laurel interrupts, saying that her apartment isn&#39;t near there, and not even on the same island. Kay adjusts the dials on the neuralizer, then shows Jay the days, months, and years dials on it, and tells him to always face it forward. He hands it to Jay. Jay tries to object, but Kay says that being down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach is one of a hundred memories that he wants to forget. Jay puts on his sunglasses. Kay tells Jay that he&#39;ll see him around, but Jay replies that he won&#39;t and zaps him with the neuralizer.The New York Post reports that Detroit has a car that defies gravity. The Weekly World News reports: &#34;N.Y. Mets centerfielder says &#39;UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN!&#39;&#34; The Enquirer reports that a man awakens from a 35-year coma; it has a photo of Kay standing with his wife while giving her flowers. Jay chuckles as he takes all three newspapers. He puts his dark sunglasses on then turns around when Laurel calls him. He walks back to the car from the hot dog stand carrying two hot dogs. She&#39;s dressed in a black suit and is now one of the MiB, and tells him that Zed called: the high consulate from Solaxiant Nine wants floor seats for the Knicks-Bulls game. Jay tells her that they&#39;ll call Dennis Rodman because he&#39;s from that planet, and gives her the hot dogs. She remarks that it&#39;s not much of a disguise. They drive away.The view zooms out from Manhattan, Earth and the Moon, then the solar system and the entire Milky Way Galaxy -- revealing the galaxy to be inside a sphere like a marble. An alien hand picks up the &#34;marble&#34; and throws it against another &#34;marble&#34; (galaxy) as if it&#39;s playing a game of marbles, then picks them both up and puts them in a cloth sack containing several other &#34;marbles&#34; (galaxies).Will Smith sings &#34;Men in Black&#34; during the end credits.

<p>The way to access this database is by creating a Hive context, similar to how we declare an SQL context. First, we declare a variable <code>hiveContext</code> by instantiating it as an object of the <code>HiveContext</code> class. Then, we check how many tables are registered in this context. As we can see, the table we just stored is temporarily registered, while we have other tables registered permanently.</p>

<p>We understand 'ratio' as the result of dividing the number of movies with spoilers by the total number of movies, in this case, only those in the action genre. Clarification: A movie can belong to more than one genre. In this case, we will count all movies that have the "Action" genre, even if they belong to other genres as well.</p>
<p>From now on, we will make more intensive use of Spark functions: <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/">https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/</a></p>
<p>The genre information is in the <code>details</code> file, while the spoiler information is in the <code>reviews</code> file. Therefore, we will need to perform a join between the two DataFrames again.</p>
<p>To calculate the ratio, first we need to filter the movies that belong to the "Action" genre and then perform the join with the <code>reviews</code> DataFrame to count the movies with spoilers.</p>

<p>Here is the translation of your request into English:</p>
<p>We want to know the average age of the movies (in years), taking the release date as a reference against the current date. The result should be displayed in years.</p>
<p>As we encountered earlier with the ratings, it is necessary to change the format of the release date to a date format, since it is currently a string and Spark cannot operate with it. Therefore, we will use a new Spark function: to_date() on the release date field.</p>
